// The agent is a thin static binary that runs as PID 1 inside every task pod
// (ADR 0004). It talks to the control plane over gRPC and never to the
// Kubernetes API, so it must not link the Kubernetes client libraries — their
// transitive graph is large enough to dominate a binary this size.
//
// CI already caps the built binary at 20 MB, but that gate is a poor guard for
// this: it needs a build, it only fires once the bloat crosses the cap (a
// partial import that fits under it slips through), and when it does fire it
// reports a number rather than a cause. This asserts the property directly and
// names it, in milliseconds and without building anything.
//
// The realistic way this breaks is indirect: someone adds a k8s import to a
// package the agent already depends on — internal/domain is the near miss,
// which gained k8s.io/apimachinery for resource-quantity validation and is not
// imported by the agent today. Nothing enforces that it stays that way except
// this test.
