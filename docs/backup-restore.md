# Backup and restore

Lite ships two commands that snapshot and re-load the whole install in one
portable file: `leoflow lite backup` and `leoflow lite restore`. Use them to
migrate to another machine, survive an OS reinstall, or roll back a botched
pre-alpha upgrade.

!!! warning "Pre-alpha"
    The archive format is documented as `manifest_version: 1`. We will not
    silently break it, but we may add fields. A future binary will refuse an
    older archive only if `manifest_version` changes — a pure-version mismatch
    on `leoflow_version` is fine.

## What is included

A backup archive (`leoflow-backup-<timestamp>.tar.gz`) contains:

| File / dir | Contents |
|---|---|
| `MANIFEST.json` | Format version, `leoflow_version`, embedded schema version, Postgres version, `created_at` |
| `config.yaml` | The admin email + password hash, JWT signing secret, parser command, workspace path |
| `setup.json` | Setup metadata (Python interpreter, OS/arch) |
| `datastore.sql` | A logical `pg_dump` (--clean --if-exists, plain SQL) of the managed Postgres — DAGs, runs, task instances, XCom, Variables, Connections |
| `workspace/` | Your project tree (DAGs, `leoflow.yaml`, etc.). VCS dirs and virtualenvs are excluded (see below) |

What is **not** included:

- `~/.leoflow/python/` (managed CPython) — re-fetched by `leoflow setup` on the
  target machine if needed.
- `~/.leoflow/postgres/` (managed PG binaries) — same.
- `~/.leoflow/venv/` (parser/runtime venv) — re-installed lazily.
- VCS metadata (`.git`, `.hg`, `.svn`).
- Build artifacts (`.venv`, `venv`, `__pycache__`, `.pytest_cache`,
  `node_modules`, `.tox`, `.mypy_cache`).

The trade-off: backups are small and portable (the heavy stuff is what the
binary can fetch back), and they will not silently leak `.git/` history a
user committed locally but did not push.

## Backup

```sh
# Default: leoflow-backup-<UTC-timestamp>.tar.gz in the current directory.
leoflow lite backup

# Custom output path:
leoflow lite backup --output ~/snapshots/before-alpha-upgrade.tar.gz
```

`backup` requires Lite to be running (it talks to the managed Postgres via
its socket to capture a consistent dump). Run `leoflow lite` in another
terminal first.

## Restore

```sh
# Refuses to overwrite an existing ~/.leoflow install:
leoflow lite restore --input ~/snapshots/before-alpha-upgrade.tar.gz

# Use --force to overwrite explicitly (e.g. after `leoflow uninstall`):
leoflow lite restore --input ~/snapshots/before-alpha-upgrade.tar.gz --force
```

The restore command refuses, with a clear error, when:

1. **The archive's schema is newer than this binary supports** — refusing
   the restore is the inverse of the upgrade-time drift detector (see
   [Upgrades](upgrades.md)). Loading rows into a DB the binary cannot read
   would corrupt them.
2. **`~/.leoflow/` already holds an install** and `--force` is not set.
   Pass `--force` only after confirming you want to overwrite.
3. **The archive's `MANIFEST.json` is missing** or carries a `manifest_version`
   newer than this binary understands.

`--force` does **not** silence the schema-drift refusal. Corruption is not
opt-in.

## Worked example: migrate to a new machine

```sh
# On the source machine (Lite running):
leoflow lite backup --output /tmp/snap.tar.gz
scp /tmp/snap.tar.gz user@new-host:~/

# On the new machine, after `curl ... install.sh`:
leoflow setup           # provisions managed Python + binaries
leoflow lite restore --input ~/snap.tar.gz
leoflow lite            # boots with the restored datastore + workspace
```

## Worked example: roll back a botched pre-alpha upgrade

```sh
# Before upgrading: take a snapshot.
leoflow lite backup --output ~/snap-before-upgrade.tar.gz

# Upgrade (re-run install.sh, restart leoflow lite). Something breaks.

# Wipe and restore. --purge removes the new install completely; restore
# refuses without it because ~/.leoflow is non-empty after the upgrade.
leoflow uninstall --purge
# Re-install the previous version's binaries via install.sh's pin, then:
leoflow lite restore --input ~/snap-before-upgrade.tar.gz
leoflow lite
```

## Production (Pro)

The Helm-installed Pro control plane does **not** ship its own
backup/restore commands. Production operators own the Postgres backup story
via standard tooling:

- Managed Postgres providers (RDS, Cloud SQL, etc.) offer point-in-time
  recovery and automated snapshots.
- Self-hosted Postgres: use `pg_dump` / `pg_dumpall` on a cron + an offsite
  archive (S3, GCS).
- Persistent volumes: capture via Velero or your cluster's volume snapshot
  controller.

The PR that hardens the Helm chart (#96) will add a `BACKUP.md` to the
chart README pointing at the upstream guidance.
