# GCP SSH connection

Run commands on a Google Compute Engine VM over SSH from a task, via a managed
Leoflow Connection. The host, port, and credentials are encrypted at rest and
delivered to the task as `AIRFLOW_CONN_<CONN_ID>`.

```yaml
connectors: [gcpssh]
```

## URI shape

```
gcpssh://<login>:<password>@<host>:<port>
```

The control plane percent-escapes the password; `ComputeEngineSSHHook` (which
parses `AIRFLOW_CONN_<ID>`) un-escapes it back.

## Fields the UI asks for

| Field | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Conn Id | yes | e.g. `gcpssh_default`. Exported as `AIRFLOW_CONN_GCPSSH_DEFAULT`. |
| Conn Type | yes | `gcpssh`. |
| Host | yes | The VM's IP or DNS name, e.g. `10.0.0.5`. |
| Port | optional | Defaults to `22`. |
| Login | yes | The OS login user on the VM. |
| Password | yes | Stored encrypted at rest (ADR 0019). Percent-escaped in the URI. |
| Extra | optional | JSON for hook-specific options (project, zone, IAP). |

## Example DAG

The hook is imported inside the task body so DAG parsing stays import-light.

```python
from airflow.decorators import dag, task
from pendulum import datetime


@dag(schedule=None, start_date=datetime(2026, 1, 1), catchup=False)
def gcpssh_run():
    @task
    def remote():
        from airflow.providers.google.cloud.hooks.compute_ssh import (
            ComputeEngineSSHHook,
        )

        hook = ComputeEngineSSHHook(gcp_conn_id="gcpssh_default")
        client = hook.get_conn()
        _, stdout, _ = client.exec_command("uname -a")
        return stdout.read().decode()

    remote()


gcpssh_run()
```

```yaml
# leoflow.yaml
connectors: [gcpssh]
```

## Security notes

- **Prefer keys / IAP over passwords**: production Compute Engine SSH normally
  uses OS Login or an SSH key plus Identity-Aware Proxy; pass those in Extra.
  The password field is for environments that still rely on it.
- **Secrets in logs**: never `print()` the URI — it carries the password.
  Log the host + login only.
- **gRPC channel (agent ↔ control plane)**: secrets are served only over an
  authenticated channel (ADR 0021); Pro must run with TLS.
