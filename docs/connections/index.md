# Connections cookbook

A Connection is a piece of credentialised configuration the control plane
encrypts at rest (ADR 0019) and delivers to a running task as
`AIRFLOW_CONN_<CONN_ID>` (ADR 0021). User code (Python `psycopg2`,
`requests`, your operator of choice) reads the env var and connects.

This page is the index. Each linked entry below is a focused recipe with the
URI shape, an example DAG, and how to test it.

!!! warning "Pre-alpha"
    Only a subset of Airflow's standard connection types are documented +
    tested at this stage. The list below grows as we land them.

## Installing a connector's provider

A Connection only carries credentials. To *use* a connector — whether through
its Airflow hook (`PostgresHook`) or a raw driver (`psycopg2`) — the matching
Python package has to be in the image / venv. Leoflow gives you two ways to
declare that in `leoflow.yaml`, and you pick whichever fits:

=== "connectors: (the sugar)"

    ```yaml
    dag_id: my_pipeline
    connectors:
      - postgres
      - http
    ```

    Short names you don't have to memorise. At compile, each expands to its
    `apache-airflow-providers-*` package (ADR 0038), which pulls the hook **and**
    its driver transitively — so `connectors: [postgres]` is enough to use either
    `PostgresHook` or raw `psycopg2`. One line per connector, no version to recall.

=== "dependencies: (the escape hatch)"

    ```yaml
    dag_id: my_pipeline
    dependencies:
      - apache-airflow-providers-postgres==6.0.0   # pin the provider, or…
      - psycopg2-binary==2.9.10                    # …just the driver, your call
    ```

    Full control: pin an exact version, install only the driver, or add a package
    the catalog doesn't know about. Advanced users who already think in pip
    specifiers stay here.

Both lists are additive — the effective install is `expand(connectors) +
dependencies`. A name in `connectors:` that isn't in the catalog **fails the
compile** with the offender, the known list, and a pointer to `dependencies:`,
so a typo never slips through to a runtime `ModuleNotFoundError` in the task pod.

!!! tip "Import provider hooks inside the task function"
    Leoflow parses your DAG without providers installed (the parser only needs the
    DAG's *shape*). So put hook/operator imports **inside** the `@task` body, not at
    the module top level:

    ```python
    @task
    def load():
        from airflow.providers.postgres.hooks.postgres import PostgresHook  # here
        hook = PostgresHook(postgres_conn_id="pg_target")
        ...
    ```

    A provider import at the module top level fails the compile with an actionable
    message telling you to move it into the task and declare it via `connectors:`.
    The import works at runtime because `connectors:`/`dependencies:` installed the
    provider into the task image / venv.

### Connector → provider package

The catalog is **generated** from a real Airflow install (`scripts/gen_connectors.py`
→ `internal/connectors/catalog.json`, ADR 0039), so ~86 connector types ship with
a dropdown entry, the correct standard-field behavior, and the provider-specific
**custom fields** served to the form (e.g. Snowflake's `account`/`warehouse`, the
GCP keyfile) in the exact param-spec shape the Airflow 3.2 `FlexibleForm` consumes.
It is the single source of truth shared by the admin form, the sugar expansion, and
compile validation.

!!! note "What's verified"
    The field *metadata* is verified end-to-end: it is generated from Airflow's own
    serializer and pinned by a Go test (`TestConnectionHookMetaExtraFieldsFlexibleFormShape`),
    and the delivered `AIRFLOW_CONN_*` URI is accepted by real Airflow's
    `Connection.from_uri`. The one piece confirmed only by manual UI check is the
    SPA *visually rendering* those custom inputs. For a connector whose creds live
    in Extra, you can always fall back to the raw **Extra (JSON)** field.

The common head:

| `connectors:` name | pip package |
|---|---|
| `postgres` | `apache-airflow-providers-postgres` |
| `mysql` | `apache-airflow-providers-mysql` |
| `sqlite` | `apache-airflow-providers-sqlite` |
| `mssql` | `apache-airflow-providers-microsoft-mssql` |
| `oracle` | `apache-airflow-providers-oracle` |
| `redis` | `apache-airflow-providers-redis` |
| `mongo` | `apache-airflow-providers-mongo` |
| `http` | `apache-airflow-providers-http` |
| `aws` | `apache-airflow-providers-amazon` |
| `google_cloud_platform` (alias `gcp`, `google`) | `apache-airflow-providers-google` |
| `snowflake` | `apache-airflow-providers-snowflake` |
| `ssh` | `apache-airflow-providers-ssh` |
| `ftp` | `apache-airflow-providers-ftp` |
| `sftp` | `apache-airflow-providers-sftp` |
| `kafka` | `apache-airflow-providers-apache-kafka` |

The package boundary is **not** a mechanical join of the dotted hook path
(`amazon.aws` → `amazon`; `microsoft.mssql` → `microsoft-mssql`), which is
exactly why the mapping is curated rather than derived.

When you press **Test** on a connection of a known type, the result line also
reminds you to declare the provider (`connectors: [<type>]`) — a Connection in the
UI carries credentials, but the DAG still has to install the hook to use them.

## Connector matrix

Every documented connector, its `conn_type`, the provider package the
`connectors:` sugar expands to (ADR 0038), the **auth shape** (where the
credential lives), the **local-testable tier**, and a runnable example. Each ships
a chain-of-custody delivery test; the tier-1 rows also ship an automated example
test (see [the contract below](#contract-every-entry-honours)). Cloud families
share a provider package (e.g. `redshift`/`athena`/`emr` →
`apache-airflow-providers-amazon`; `gcpbigquery`/`gcpcloudsql`/`gcp_looker` →
`…-google`); the boundary is curated, not a mechanical join of the hook path.

**Local tier** — *local (Docker)*: spin the service up with Docker/Lima and run the
example end-to-end; *local (tier 1)*: no external service needed (or already in CI);
*doc-only*: a real run needs the external account/service, so the page is a recipe with
a delivery test rather than a runnable example. **Example** — *recipe* links back to the
connector's own page (the copy-paste DAG lives there).

## The long tail

Every curated connector above is first-class (impl + delivery test + cookbook).
Beyond them, **all ~86 connector types in the generated catalog** (ADR 0039) are
usable today via `connectors:` (dropdown + sugar) — they just don't each have a
dedicated cookbook recipe yet. Any other Airflow provider works via
`dependencies:`. Recipes are added connector-by-connector as they are promoted.

## Contract every entry honours

Every entry in this cookbook ships with all three of:

1. **A doc page** (this dir) covering: URI shape, default port, Lite-vs-Pro
   caveats, security notes (TLS, auth modes).
2. **An example DAG** under `examples/<type>_*/` with its own
   `README.md` showing how to spin up the dependency (Docker / Lima), how
   to create the Connection in the UI, and the expected end-state of the
   target system.
3. **An automated test** that proves the delivery chain — the integration
   test under `internal/storage/` (companion to the example) gated by the
   `integration` build tag, runs in CI against a real Postgres.

If a layer is mocked or the e2e test is manual-only, the doc says so and a
follow-up issue covers the gap.
