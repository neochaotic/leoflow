# Map-reduce in Leoflow

> One pattern, every parallel workflow: a fan-out of independent tasks that
> a single downstream task **reduces** into a result. Hyperparameter search,
> k-fold cross-validation, batch inference, ETL shard aggregation —
> Leoflow expresses them all in two lines of Python.

## The pattern

```python
from airflow.sdk import DAG, task

@task
def trial(lr: float) -> dict:
    return train_one(lr)          # map: pure per-shard compute

@task
def select_best(trials: list[dict]) -> dict:
    return max(trials, key=lambda r: r["score"])   # reduce: combine results

with DAG("hparam_search", schedule=None):
    select_best([trial(lr) for lr in [0.001, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5]])
```

That `[trial(lr) for lr in …]` is the whole map. The argument `trials: list[dict]`
is the whole reduce. **No XCom plumbing, no broker setup, no shared filesystem,
no special operator.** Just a list comprehension and a function that takes a list.

At runtime:

1. Leoflow fans out — every `trial(lr=…)` is a separate task instance running
   in parallel (its own pod on Pro; its own subprocess on Lite).
2. Each map task returns its result; Leoflow stores it as XCom keyed by
   `(dag_id, run_id, task_id, return_value)`.
3. When all upstreams finish, Leoflow dispatches `select_best`. The agent
   fetches every upstream's XCom, assembles them into a JSON array (in
   declaration order), and stamps it as `LEOFLOW_XCOM_TRIALS`.
4. The runtime delivers the list directly to your function.

## When fan-in activates

The parser activates fan-in based on the **shape of the argument** at the
call site, nothing else. Three forms are equivalent:

```python
# 1. List comprehension — the common form, scales to N
select_best([trial(lr) for lr in [0.001, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5]])

# 2. Explicit list of task calls
combine([estimate(0), estimate(1), estimate(2)])

# 3. Tuple instead of list — also works
report((extract_a(), extract_b()))
```

All three produce the same `xcom_input[param] = [task_id_1, …, task_id_N]`
in `dag.json`.

What does **not** activate fan-in:

| Code | What happens |
|---|---|
| `transform(extract())` | Single upstream. The parser captures one task_id (a 1-element list internally) — the function's parameter receives the value directly, not a list. |
| `shard(n=0)` | Literal kwarg. Captured as `call_args.n = 0` and delivered via `LEOFLOW_CALL_ARGS_JSON`. No XCom, no upstream. |
| `start >> [a, b, c]` | Dependency edge only. No argument binding — downstream gets no list. |
| `f(items=[1, 2, 3])` | Plain literal list. JSON-serialised into `call_args.items`, not fan-in. |
| `aggregate([shard(0), 42, foo()])` | Mixed list (XComArg + literal). Currently silently dropped; intended to become a hard error. |

The rule: **every element of the list must be a task call** for the parser to
treat the whole argument as fan-in.

## Guarantees and limits

- **Scope.** Fan-in is always *N upstreams in the same DagRun → one
  downstream*. It never crosses DAGs or runs. The XCom lookup is keyed by
  `(tenant, dag_id, run_id, upstream_task_id)`.
- **N is compile-time.** Both `range(SHARDS)` examples below produce
  exactly `SHARDS` tasks; the count is fixed when the DAG is compiled, not
  discovered at runtime. Dynamic mapping (Airflow's `.expand()`) is **not
  supported yet** — the parser refuses it loudly so you do not get a
  silent partial run.
- **N == 1 also flows through the fan-in path.** The schema is uniform
  (always a list), but a 1-element list looks identical to a normal
  single-upstream call from the user's perspective. There is no special
  case to remember.
- **Order is declaration-order, not finish-order.** Trial 3 that finishes
  first stays at index 3 in the list the reducer receives. This is what
  most ML code expects (you can pair indices with hyperparameters).
- **An absent upstream contributes `null`.** If `estimate__2` failed and
  pushed no XCom, the reducer sees `[v0, v1, null, v3]`. Your reducer
  decides what `null` means; the default `trigger_rule="all_success"`
  means a failed upstream blocks the reducer entirely, so you only hit
  `null` when you opt into `trigger_rule="all_done"` (or similar).
- **The XCom 256 KB ceiling applies per upstream**, and the assembled
  array is also subject to it on the wire — keep return values small
  (metrics dicts, paths to artifacts), not full models or dataframes.
  Tracking issue for spill-to-storage is on the roadmap.

## Why this matters for ML

Most ML workloads are map-reduce: independent work per shard, then one
aggregator. Leoflow's contract makes this cheap and durable:

| ML pattern | Map | Reduce |
|---|---|---|
| Hyperparameter search | one task per `(lr, batch, seed)` triple | pick the best metric |
| K-fold cross-validation | one task per fold | average the metrics |
| Ensemble training | one task per base model | combine predictions / stack |
| Sharded preprocessing | one task per data shard | concatenate / merge index |
| Batch inference | one task per partition | collect predictions to a sink |
| Monte-Carlo simulation | one task per worker | average / sum results |

The Leoflow runtime is **container-native** (pod-per-task on Pro, subprocess-per-task
on Lite), so every map task gets a clean process with its own memory, deps, and
GPU slice when you ask for one. No shared interpreter, no GIL contention, no
"why did training 7 leak memory into training 9."

## Reliability — what fan-in buys you

- **Per-trial isolation.** A crash in trial 3 doesn't take down trials 0–2 or
  4–9. Their XComs are already pushed; the reducer sees `null` in slot 3 and
  decides what that means.
- **Per-trial retry.** Trial 7 fails on attempt 1, retries on attempt 2,
  succeeds. The reducer only runs once everyone's terminal — and only sees
  successful results unless you opt into `trigger_rule="all_done"`.
- **Resume after a restart.** XComs are durable; if the reducer crashes or
  the control plane restarts, the next run can clear-and-rerun just the
  reducer without re-doing the expensive map step.
- **Deterministic ordering.** The reducer receives upstreams in the
  declaration order of the list comprehension, not the order they finished.

## What the parser captures (under the hood)

For

```python
select_best([trial(lr) for lr in [0.001, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5]])
```

the parser writes this into `dag.json`:

```json
{
  "tasks": [
    {
      "task_id": "select_best",
      "depends_on": ["trial", "trial__1", "trial__2", "trial__3", "trial__4"],
      "xcom_input": {
        "trials": ["trial", "trial__1", "trial__2", "trial__3", "trial__4"]
      }
    },
    {"task_id": "trial",    "call_args": {"lr": 0.001}},
    {"task_id": "trial__1", "call_args": {"lr": 0.01}},
    {"task_id": "trial__2", "call_args": {"lr": 0.05}},
    {"task_id": "trial__3", "call_args": {"lr": 0.1}},
    {"task_id": "trial__4", "call_args": {"lr": 0.5}}
  ]
}
```

- `depends_on` is the dependency edge — what scheduler waits on.
- `xcom_input.trials` is the chain-of-custody for the reducer's `trials`
  parameter — the agent fetches each task's return value and assembles them
  in this exact order.
- `call_args.lr` is the literal each trial gets — captured at compile time
  so the worker doesn't need the DAG-build context at runtime.

## End-to-end example

`examples/ml_hparam_search/` ships a runnable version of the snippet at the
top. It uses a toy quadratic instead of a real model so it runs in
milliseconds:

```bash
leoflow lite                              # boot Lite
# UI → DAGs → ml_hparam_search → Play
```

In the run page you will see five `trial` tasks fan out in parallel, then
`select_best` fires once all five succeed. Open `select_best`'s logs to see
the chosen `lr` and its score; open the XCom tab on any task to see its
return value.

## Beyond the basics

- **`max_active_tasks`** caps how many map tasks run in parallel (cluster
  pressure, GPU slots). Set it on the DAG.
- **`retries`** + **`retry_delay_seconds`** make each map task survive
  transient infrastructure flakes.
- **Per-task `resources`** in `leoflow.yaml` give each trial its own CPU /
  memory / GPU budget.
- **`trigger_rule="all_done"`** runs the reducer even when some trials fail,
  letting you decide what `null` in `trials` means.

## Roadmap

- Dynamic mapping (the parser auto-detects `[f(x) for x in <runtime-list>]`)
  and lifts the fan-in degree from "compile-time literal" to "discovered at
  run-time." Coming after the alpha cut.
