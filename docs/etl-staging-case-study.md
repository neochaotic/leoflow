# Case study: a real 1 GB ETL on the staging volume

A worked, **measured** end-to-end pipeline: generate ~1 GB, process it with DuckDB,
and load the result into an external Postgres — all on `leoflow dev` running real
pods on a single-node k3d cluster (a "pseudo-cluster" on a laptop). Every number
below was measured on that setup.

!!! abstract "What it exercises"
    Per-run **staging volume** (ADR 0022) · **DuckDB** out-of-core processing ·
    cross-pod data sharing · an **external load** through a managed **Connection**
    (ADR 0019/0021) · the volume **lifecycle** (success vs. failure) · **clear +
    re-run** with staged-data reuse (ADR 0020) · per-deployment **version** tracing.

## The pipeline

Three tasks, each in its own pod, sharing one `/staging` volume for the run. XCom
carries only small paths/metadata; the GBs live on `/staging`.

            cur = conn.cursor()

    ```

## Measured results

Single-node k3d on a 10-core laptop, **real pods**, `--executor=k8s`:

| Task | Work | DuckDB time | Pod time |
|---|---|---|---|
| **extract** | 70,000,000 rows → `raw.parquet` (**1,056 MB**) | 7.7 s | 8.9 s |
| **transform** | 70M rows → 50 groups → `agg.parquet` | 0.3 s | 1.1 s |
| **load** | agg → 50 rows into external Postgres | — | 0.8 s |
| **whole run** | including pod scheduling | | **~21–25 s** |

DuckDB is vectorized, multi-threaded, and out-of-core, so ~1 GB of Parquet is
written in seconds and aggregated in a fraction of a second — within a
memory-modest pod. The 1.1 GB lives on `/staging`, written by `extract` and read
by `transform` and `load` — **three pods, one disk**, verified physically:

```text
$ ls -la /staging      # mounted from the run's PVC
-rw-r--r-- 1000  1,152,463,115  raw.parquet     # ~1.1 GB
-rw-r--r-- 1000          1,940  agg.parquet
-rw-r--r-- 1000          2,800  output.csv
```

## The staging volume lifecycle (ADR 0022)

The per-run PVC is tracked in the metadatabase (`staging_volumes`: `state`,
`created_at`, `deleted_at`, `delete_reason`) — auditable: *when* and *why* each
disk was reclaimed.

| Run outcome | Volume |
|---|---|
| **Success** | deleted **immediately** at run end — `delete_reason = run_succeeded` |
| **Failure** | **kept for 24 h** after terminal (`ttl_expired` after) — so a fix-and-re-run reuses the upstream data |
| Run row gone | reclaimed once older than the TTL — `orphaned` |

A GC sweep that cannot resolve a volume's run **never deletes a fresh volume** —
only ones older than the TTL — so an active run's pods are never stranded.

## Clear + re-run reuses staged data (ADR 0020)

When `load` failed (external Postgres down), the run was **failed** so its volume
was **kept**. After fixing the external dependency, **clearing only `load`** :

- `extract` and `transform` stayed `success` (not re-run),
- `load` re-ran alone, **re-attached the same PVC** and read the existing
  `agg.parquet` (no 1 GB regeneration), and loaded successfully.

`clear` also **re-binds the run to the DAG's current version** (the single
mutability rule): a re-run after a code/yaml fix picks up the newest image — the
last hot-reload in dev, the last deploy in prod.

## The external load uses a managed Connection

The `load` target is a **Leoflow Connection** (`etl_target`), created in
Admin → Connections — encrypted at rest (ADR 0019) and **injected into the pod as
`AIRFLOW_CONN_ETL_TARGET` over an authenticated gRPC pull** (ADR 0021), so the
secret never appears in the pod spec. The task log confirms it:

```text
load: connecting via managed Connection etl_target
load: loaded 50 rows into EXTERNAL postgres warehouse.category_revenue
```

Each run is traceable to the exact **deployment** that produced it: the
`dag_versions` entry carries a deployment label (git describe in prod,
`dev-<timestamp>` in dev), surfaced as `bundle_version` on the version API.

## Gotcha: import heavy deps inside the task

`import duckdb` / `import psycopg2` go **inside** the task functions, not at module
top level. The DAG **parser** imports the module to extract structure and does not
have the task image's dependencies — a top-level heavy import fails parsing (and
lights the [Import Errors banner](dev-workflow.md#when-a-dag-is-broken)).
