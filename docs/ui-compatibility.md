# Airflow UI Compatibility — Feasibility Investigation

**Status:** Investigation (Phase 5, 2026-05-22). This document records why the
naive Phase 5 goal — *run the unmodified Apache Airflow 3.2.x web UI against the
Leoflow API* — is **not viable as stated**, and what the realistic paths are.

## Finding: Airflow 3.x decoupled the UI onto an internal API

Airflow **2.x** served a Flask/FAB server-rendered UI; the stable REST API
(`/api/v1/`) was a separate, public surface. "Be API-compatible" largely meant
matching `/api/v1/`.

Airflow **3.x** (3.0 GA, Apr 2025) **rewrote the UI as a React SPA** served by a
FastAPI **API server**, and split the backend into *two* API surfaces:

| Surface | Purpose | Stability |
|---|---|---|
| **Public REST API** `/api/v2/` | external clients, OpenAPI-documented | stable, backward-compatible |
| **UI API** `/ui/*` (AIP-84) | powers the React UI (grid, graph/structure, dashboard, calendar) with aggregated/denormalized shapes | **internal, explicitly NOT backward-compatible, "should not be relied upon by external consumers"** |

The React UI is built against the **`/ui/*` API**, not the public `/api/v2/`.
The grid view, graph/structure view, and dashboard stats all come from `/ui/*`
endpoints whose shapes are tuned for the frontend and change between Airflow
releases by design (AIP-84 explicitly trades backward-compatibility away so the
UI can iterate).

### Consequence for Leoflow

Leoflow implements a subset of the **public `/api/v2/`**. It does **not**
implement `/ui/*`. Therefore:

- Pointing the **unmodified** Airflow 3.2.x UI at Leoflow's `/api/v2/` **will not
  work** — the UI calls `/ui/*` endpoints Leoflow doesn't serve.
- Implementing `/ui/*` to satisfy the UI means matching an **internal, unstable**
  API and re-chasing it on every Airflow minor release. That is a brittle,
  perpetual maintenance burden — the opposite of a stable compatibility target.

The original premise ("the `/api/v2/` API matches Airflow 3.2.x, so the UI just
works") reflects the **2.x** architecture. It does not hold for 3.x.

## Realistic paths

1. **Custom minimal UI (recommended).** Build a small React app against Leoflow's
   own stable `/api/v2/`. This is already on the post-MVP roadmap ("Custom UI
   (replacing the Airflow UI)"). It avoids chasing an internal API and gives us a
   stable contract we control. Best long-term fit with the GitOps/immutable
   thesis.
2. **Implement a pinned `/ui/*` subset.** Serve the Airflow 3.2.1 UI assets and
   implement exactly the `/ui/*` endpoints that version calls, pinned to 3.2.1.
   Delivers the familiar Airflow UI now, but is brittle and version-locked.
3. **Defer the UI.** For the MVP, the operator surface is the embedded **Scalar
   API reference** (`/docs`) plus the `leoflow runs` / `leoflow` CLI. The visual
   UI lands later via path 1 or 2.

## Public `/api/v2/` compatibility audit

Independent of the UI, the **public** API should stay Airflow-3-shaped for
external clients (Airflow operators, scripts, the `airflow` CLI's API mode). What
Leoflow exposes today aligns well on shape:

- ✅ Airflow-3 field naming: `logical_date` (not `execution_date`), `dag_run_id`,
  `task_instances`, `total_entries` pagination, the `__type` schedule field.
- ✅ Core resources: `GET /dags`, `GET|PATCH /dags/{id}`,
  `GET|POST /dags/{id}/dagRuns`, `.../taskInstances`, `.../logs/{try}`,
  `clearTaskInstances`, `xcoms`.
- ⚠️ **Breadth gap** vs Airflow 3.2 `/api/v2/`: not implemented yet —
  `/dags/{id}/details` (timetable_description, etc.), `/dagSources`, `/eventLogs`,
  `/variables`, `/connections`, `/pools`, `/assets`, `/monitor/health`,
  `/version`. These are needed for full external-client parity but not for the
  current execution surface.
- ⚠️ `/dags/{id}/versions` is **Leoflow-specific** (DAG-as-image versioning), not
  an Airflow endpoint.

## Decision: path 2 — serve the unmodified 3.2.1 UI, implement a pinned `/ui/*`

We pursue **path 2**: serve the **unmodified** Apache Airflow **3.2.1** React UI
assets and implement, in the Leoflow control plane, the `/ui/*` (and the few
extra `/api/v2/*`) endpoints that exact version calls — **pinned to 3.2.1**. We
accept the version-lock and the re-chase-on-upgrade cost; in return we get the
familiar Airflow UI without forking it.

**Risk mitigation (non-negotiable):**

1. **Authoritative shapes, never guessed.** Every endpoint we implement is
   matched against the version-pinned spec
   `airflow-core/src/airflow/api_fastapi/core_api/openapi/_private_ui.yaml`
   at tag `3.2.1` (the `/ui` API) and `v2-rest-api-generated.yaml` (public).
   That file is the single source of truth for field names and types.
2. **Do not fork or strip the SPA.** The UI is a compiled Vite bundle; surgically
   removing components is impractical and forking + rebuilding it is the brittle
   path we are avoiding. Instead we **shape the UI from the backend** (below).
3. **Pin everything.** The Airflow image tag, the spec, and the asset bundle are
   all pinned to 3.2.1. Upgrades are a deliberate, tested event.

## Graceful degradation — hide the uncovered, never break

Rather than leave dead buttons, we minimize the uncovered surface from the
backend, in three tiers:

1. **`/ui/auth/menus` (curated)** — the UI renders only the menu sections this
   endpoint authorizes. By returning only Leoflow-backed capabilities we make the
   UI **hide** unsupported sections (Assets, Connections, Variables, Pools,
   Backfills, Admin, …) entirely. No dead button, no SPA change.
2. **`/ui/config` (feature flags)** — disables UI features we do not back.
3. **Graceful stubs for the rest** — any `/ui/*` we do not implement returns a
   schema-valid **empty** payload (empty list / zeroed stats) so advanced views
   render an empty state instead of erroring; unsupported **write** actions
   return `501` with a `detail` hint the UI surfaces as a toast
   ("Not available in Leoflow yet").

## The `/ui/*` surface (Airflow 3.2.1, from `_private_ui.yaml`)

22 operations. Tiers map to the degradation strategy above.

| Tier | Endpoint | Response schema (authoritative) |
|---|---|---|
| **Auth** | `POST /ui/auth/token` | `GenerateTokenBody` → token |
| **Auth** | `GET /ui/auth/me` | `AuthenticatedMeResponse` |
| **Auth** | `GET /ui/auth/menus` | `MenuItemCollectionResponse` (`authorized_menu_items`, `extra_menu_items`) |
| **Core** | `GET /ui/config` | `ConfigResponse` (`instance_name`, `auto_refresh_interval`, `hide_paused_dags_by_default`, `theme`, …) |
| **Core** | `GET /ui/dags` | inline DAG collection (UI-shaped) |
| **Core** | `GET /ui/dags/{dag_id}/latest_run` | `DAGRunLightResponse` |
| **Core** | `GET /ui/structure/structure_data` | `StructureDataResponse` (`nodes`, `edges`) — graph view |
| **Core** | `GET /ui/grid/structure/{dag_id}` | grid topology |
| **Core** | `GET /ui/grid/runs/{dag_id}` | `GridRunsResponse[]` (`dag_id`, `run_id`, `state`, `run_type`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `duration`, …) |
| **Core** | `GET /ui/grid/ti_summaries/{dag_id}` | per-run task-instance summaries |
| Degrade | `GET /ui/dashboard/historical_metrics_data` | empty stats |
| Degrade | `GET /ui/dashboard/dag_stats` | empty stats |
| Degrade | `GET /ui/calendar/{dag_id}` | empty |
| Degrade | `GET /ui/gantt/{dag_id}/{run_id}` | empty |
| Degrade | `GET /ui/dependencies` | empty graph |
| Degrade | `GET /ui/backfills` | empty list |
| Degrade | `GET /ui/next_run_assets/{dag_id}` | empty |
| Degrade | `GET /ui/partitioned_dag_runs` · `GET /ui/pending_partitioned_dag_run/{dag_id}/{partition_key}` | empty |
| Degrade | `GET /ui/dags/{dag_id}/dagRuns/{dag_run_id}/deadlines` | empty |
| Degrade | `GET /ui/teams` | empty |
| Degrade | `GET /ui/connections/hook_meta` | empty |

Logs, trigger, clear, and pause are served by the public `/api/v2/*` Leoflow
already exposes; the UI calls those directly.

## Serving & auth architecture

```
browser ──▶ static SPA assets (Airflow 3.2.1, unmodified)
        ──▶ /ui/*    ─┐
        ──▶ /api/v2/* ─┼─▶ leoflow-server   (reverse proxy serves assets + routes API)
                       ─┘
```

- A reverse proxy (or a static-file route in leoflow-server) serves the pinned
  3.2.1 SPA bundle and routes `/ui/*` and `/api/v2/*` to the control plane.
- **Auth (dual-path — corrected 2026-05-22).** The earlier assumption that the UI
  logs in via `POST /ui/auth/token` was **wrong**: the spec's `GenerateTokenBody`
  carries **no credentials** (only an optional `token_type`), so `/ui/auth/token`
  re-mints a token for an **already-authenticated** principal — it is not the
  login endpoint. Credential login (username/password) is the **simple-auth-manager
  `POST /auth/token`**. Leoflow therefore implements **both**:
  - `POST /auth/token` — credential login → JWT (the real login; already existed).
  - `POST /ui/auth/token` — re-mint for an authed bearer → `{access_token,
    token_type, expires_in_seconds}`; 401 without a bearer.
  - **OPEN — verify in browser (Phase 5.2/5.3):** open DevTools → Network and
    capture which endpoint the 3.2.1 login form actually POSTs on submit. Record
    the finding here before closing the PR. The unused path stays as a graceful
    fallback (do not remove until 5.3 or Phase 6). The JWT is sent as
    `Authorization: Bearer` on subsequent calls; Leoflow's existing JWT issuance
    backs both, secret shared via configuration.

## Learnings log

- **2026-05-22:** Airflow 3.x split the backend into a stable public `/api/v2/`
  and an internal, non-backward-compatible `/ui/*` (AIP-84). The React UI targets
  `/ui/*`, so `/api/v2/` parity alone never renders the UI — the original premise
  (principle #8) reflected Airflow 2.x. Authoritative `/ui` shapes live in
  `_private_ui.yaml` per tag. The UI is backend-shaped via `/ui/auth/menus` and
  `/ui/config`, which is how we hide uncovered features without touching the SPA.
- **2026-05-22 (spec corrections during 5.1).** Reconciling the implementation
  against the authoritative `_private_ui.yaml`:
  - `AuthenticatedMeResponse` is `{id, username}` only (not `name`/`is_active`/
    `is_authenticated`).
  - `MenuItem` is a fixed string enum (`Required Actions, Assets, Audit Log,
    Config, Connections, Dags, Docs, Jobs, Plugins, Pools, Providers, Variables,
    XComs`) — there is **no** "Browse > DAG Runs / Task Instances" (that was
    Airflow 2.x). Curated set starts at `[Dags, Docs]`; widen only if a browser
    test proves a missing section breaks the UI.
  - `ConfigResponse` has 12 **required** fields and **no** `assets_enabled`/
    `plugins_enabled`/`is_db_isolation_mode`. `theme` is required-but-nullable (a
    Chakra-theme object or `null`), not the string `"default"`. Menus, not config
    flags, are the lever that hides sections.
  - `/ui/auth/token` is a re-mint, not login (see Serving & auth above).
- **Strategic note:** the pinned `/ui/*` is tactical for MVP velocity; a custom
  Leoflow UI on the stable `/api/v2/` is the long-term destination. See ADR 0018.
- **2026-05-22 (Phase 5.2 — DAG list, grid, graph).** Implemented the read views:
  - `GET /ui/dags` (DAGWithLatestDagRunsResponse, 30+ required fields),
    `GET /ui/dags/{id}/latest_run` (DAGRunLightResponse|null — 200 null, not 404),
    `GET /ui/grid/runs/{id}` (GridRunsResponse[]),
    `GET /ui/grid/structure/{id}` (GridNodeResponse[], topo-sorted),
    `GET /ui/structure/structure_data?dag_id=` (StructureDataResponse nodes+edges),
    `GET /api/v2/dags/{id}/details` (DAGDetailsResponse, 43 fields),
    `GET /api/v2/version`.
  - **`ti_summaries` is an NDJSON stream**, not a single map: `GET /ui/grid/ti_summaries/{id}?run_ids=`
    returns `application/x-ndjson`, one `GridTISummaries` per run. (The 5.2 prompt's
    "run_id→task_id→state map" was wrong; spec wins.)
  - **Impedance gaps mapped, not faked away:** `DAGRunLightResponse.id` is an
    integer in the spec but Leoflow keys runs by `(dag_id, run_id)` — `id` is a
    stable FNV hash of run_id, a display key only; `run_after` maps to logical
    date (no separate field); `has_missed_deadline`, task groups, dynamic mapping,
    bundle/fileloc/parse metadata are absent → null/false/defaults. Topology comes
    from `dag_versions.spec` (the JSON the Python parser emitted); reads are Go.
  - **Performance posture:** `/ui/dags` latest runs via one LATERAL window query
    (no N+1); `ti_summaries` one join grouped in Go with a weak ETag over
    (count, max timestamp) since `task_instances` has no `updated_at`.
  - **OPEN (needs live PG / browser):** integration fixtures (3×10×5), the 20k-TI
    perf budget + EXPLAIN ANALYZE, and the browser walk of grid/graph rendering
    are verification steps to run with `make dev-up` and a real browser.
