# Leoflow UI Walk — Verified Findings

**Date:** 2026-05-23
**Method:** The live demo stack (`docker compose --profile demo up`) driven by a
headless Chromium (Playwright, dockerized). Authenticated via the `_token`
cookie, navigated the screens **by clicking** (not deep-linking — direct
navigation to client routes like `/` 404s in the SPA), screenshotted each, and
captured console errors + non-2xx requests. Every screenshot below was inspected
and every finding cross-checked against the authoritative `_private_ui.yaml`
(3.2.1) — so this supersedes the earlier external audit where the two disagree.

> Why no side-by-side with real Airflow for most screens: Leoflow serves the
> **unmodified** Airflow 3.2.1 SPA, so the layout/chrome *is* Airflow's. A
> real-Airflow comparison only adds value for data-shape differences; it is
> worth doing specifically for the empty Graph view (below).

## Summary

The DAG **list** and **grid** render with full fidelity — including the run
state colors and the per-DAG fields the earlier external audit wrongly told us to
strip. The **graph** view renders an **empty canvas** (top bug). A few `/api/v2`
endpoints the UI polls still 404, and the Overview "Failed Runs" widget
miscounts.

## Screens

### DAG list — ✅ renders correctly
![DAG list](screenshots/01_dags_list.png)

`demo_http_chain` shows schedule `@daily`, the latest run with a green check, and
**three green run squares** (its 3 successful runs); pause/trigger/favorite/delete
controls render. The filter chips (Failed/Queued/Running/Success), tags filter,
and sort all render. **This directly refutes the external audit's "strip
`description`/`bundle_version`/`next_dagrun_*`/`start_date`/`end_date` from
`/ui/dags`" recommendation** — those fields are *required* by the 3.2.1 schema and
the list renders correctly with them present.

### Grid view — ✅ renders correctly
![Grid demo_http_chain](screenshots/02_grid_http_chain.png)

`step_a/step_b/step_c` each show three green ✓ cells (3 successful runs). The DAG
header (schedule, latest run, max active runs, owner) and the tab bar (Overview /
Runs / Tasks / Calendar / Backfills / Audit Log / Code / Details) render. The grid
left column is driven by `/ui/grid/structure` (incl. the required `is_mapped`) and
the cell colors by `/ui/grid/ti_summaries` — both correct. The external audit's
"Grid broken" applies only to mapped tasks / task groups, which the MVP does not
model; for normal DAGs the grid is correct.

`demo_pipeline` (no runs) shows its `extract`/`transform`/`load` task rows.

### Graph view — ✅ FIXED (was an empty canvas)
![Graph demo_pipeline](screenshots/05_pipeline_graph.png)

The graph now renders the topology: `extract` (python) → `transform` (bash) →
`load` (http_api) as connected React Flow nodes, with "Latest Dag Version: v1" in
the header.

**Root-cause chain (found by diffing against real Airflow 3.2.1 on a side cluster,
not from the SPA prose):** the graph fetches
`GET /ui/structure/structure_data?dag_id=…&version_number=N` — it needs a
`version_number`. The SPA reads that from **`GET /api/v2/dags/{id}/details` →
`latest_dag_version.version_number`**, which in turn comes from
`GET /api/v2/dags/{id}/dagVersions`. Both of those **404'd** for us, so:
`dagVersions 404` → `details.latest_dag_version: null` → no `version_number` →
`structure_data` never fetched → blank canvas.

**Fix (this PR):**
- Implement `GET /api/v2/dags/{id}/dagVersions` (real `version_number` from the
  stored versions via a `row_number()` window — integration-tested against live PG).
- Populate `details.latest_dag_version` from the version lister.
- Add the optional node/edge fields to `structure_data` (`is_mapped`, `tooltip`,
  `setup_teardown_type`, `asset_condition_type`; `is_setup_teardown`, `label`,
  `is_source_asset`) so the response matches real Airflow exactly.

Verified live in the browser (the screenshot above) and via the captured network
trace (`structure_data` now returns 200).

## Non-2xx requests captured (to stub/implement)

- `GET /api/v2/dags/{id}/dagRuns/~/taskInstances?…state=failed&order_by=-run_after`
  → **404**. The Overview "Failed Tasks/Failed Runs" widgets poll this (`~` = all
  runs). Its failure is why the **Overview "Failed Runs" widget shows `3` for a
  DAG with 3 *successful* runs** — a visible miscount.
- `GET /api/v2/dags/{id}/dagVersions?order_by=-version_number` → **404**. Backs the
  header "Latest Dag Version" field.
- `GET /api/v2/dags/~/dagRuns` (home global run view) → already fixed (degrades to
  an empty collection).

## Other observations

- **Sidebar/menu:** Home, Dags, **Assets**, Docs (+ clock, User). Browse and Admin
  are correctly hidden by the curated `/ui/auth/menus`; **Assets is built-in nav,
  not menu-curated**, so it still appears (its pages degrade to empty states).
- **MIME warning** (`Failed to load module script … MIME type "text/html"`):
  upstream Airflow 3.2.1 build artifact, safe to ignore.

## Recommended next work

1. ~~Fix the empty Graph view~~ — **done** (dagVersions + details.latest_dag_version
   + structure_data fields; see above).
2. ~~`dagRuns/~/taskInstances` and `dagVersions`~~ — **done**: `dagVersions`
   implemented; the two `~` wildcards (`dagRuns/~/taskInstances`, `~/dagRuns`)
   degrade to empty collections (real cross-run/cross-DAG aggregation is a
   follow-up so the Overview "Failed Runs" widget shows real counts).
3. Decide whether to hide the Assets nav (it is built-in, not menu-driven).

## Note on the external (Antigravity) audit

It is a useful lead generator (it found the `~`-wildcard 404s and documented the
write-path payloads), but its **schema diagnosis is unreliable**: it repeatedly
recommended removing fields that are *required* by the 3.2.1 spec (verified here —
the list/grid render correctly with them) and its v2 "screenshots" were all 404
pages (bad deep-links). Treat it as a source of leads, validated against the spec
and the browser — which is what this report does.
