// Package leoflow embeds the Python parser and runtime package sources so a
// binary-only install (no source checkout) can provision them. The dev source
// trees under parser/ and runtime/python/ remain the canonical copies; this
// embed reads them directly at build time, so there is no duplicated source.
//
// The all: prefix is required on the package directories: Python packages
// contain __init__.py, and go:embed's default rules drop names beginning with
// "_" or ".". The patterns are scoped to the package dir plus pyproject.toml /
// README.md (what pip needs) so the dev-only test fixtures and dot-caches
// (.pytest_cache, .ruff_cache, .coverage) are not embedded. Build from a clean
// tree (no __pycache__) so stale bytecode is not embedded.

import "embed"

// Four patterns across two directives, and runtime/python/leoflow has to be its
// own: all:runtime/python/leoflow_runtime cannot match it. Omitting it is silent
// — hatchling ships a wheel without a `packages` entry whose directory is absent,
// no error and no warning, so a binary-only Lite install would build every
// per-DAG venv from a pysrc tree with no authoring package in it (#17). The all:
// prefix is what carries files beginning with an underscore, which __init__.py
// does. .gitignore is named explicitly for the same reason — a directory walk
// skips dotfiles, and that one has to travel: hatchling resolves its ignore
// patterns by walking up from its own root, so without it a build from
// ~/.leoflow/pysrc reaches $HOME's. embed_test.go asserts each of these arrives.
