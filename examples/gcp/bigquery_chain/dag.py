"""gcp_bigquery_chain — BigQuery operators with chaining, through Leoflow's generic
operator path (ADR 0040). Demonstrates operator-to-operator XCom: ``second_job``
consumes ``first_job``'s output (its job id) via ``{{ ti.xcom_pull('first_job') }}``,
which Leoflow resolves like Airflow.

Set the constants below for your environment. Credentials come from the
``google_cloud_platform`` Connection / ADC (see ``examples/gcp_gcs_load``);
``connectors: [gcp]`` installs the provider. The dataset is created and dropped, so the
run leaves nothing behind.
