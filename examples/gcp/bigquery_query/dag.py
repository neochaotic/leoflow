"""gcp_bigquery_query — a single real BigQuery operator through Leoflow's generic
operator path (ADR 0040), credentials from the google_cloud_platform connector.

Runs one query with BigQueryInsertJobOperator against a BigQuery public dataset
(no setup, free-tier). Set PROJECT to a project you can run BigQuery jobs in
(billing/execution project); credentials come from the google_cloud_platform
Connection / ADC and ``connectors: [gcp]`` installs the provider.
