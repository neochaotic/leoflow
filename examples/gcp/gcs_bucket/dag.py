"""gcp_gcs_bucket — Google Cloud Storage operators through Leoflow's generic
operator path (ADR 0040). A self-contained bucket lifecycle: create -> list -> delete,
using the real Google provider operators (not a hand-written client).

Set the constants below for your environment. Credentials come from the
``google_cloud_platform`` Connection / ADC (see ``examples/gcp_gcs_load`` for the auth
modes); ``connectors: [gcp]`` installs the provider.
