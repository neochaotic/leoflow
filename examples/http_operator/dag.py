"""http_operator — HttpOperator hitting a public API.

Leoflow compiles an HttpOperator to an 'airflow_operator' task that runs in its
own task pod (ADR 0040), like any other provider operator — declare
`connectors: [http]` so the provider is installed in the image. (The old native
inline 'http_api' type, which ran the request in the control plane, was removed —
ADR 0047/0048.) The endpoint here is a full URL, so no Connection is needed.
