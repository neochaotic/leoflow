"""ml_hparam_search — parallel hyperparameter search, classic ML map-reduce.

Five trial tasks train (toy) models in parallel with different learning rates;
the `select_best` task fans in all five results and picks the highest score.
This is the canonical map-reduce DAG pattern in ML: independent compute per
trial, then a single aggregation step.

Topology (map-reduce):

    trial(lr=0.001)  ─┐
    trial(lr=0.01)   ─┤
    trial(lr=0.05)   ─┼─► select_best  ── prints winner + reports XCom
    trial(lr=0.1)    ─┤
    trial(lr=0.5)    ─┘

Each `trial` runs as its own pod/process (parallel by default); `select_best`
receives the list of all trial outputs and reduces them into a single result.

For a real workload, swap the body of `trial` for actual training (a single
DataLoader pass, a scikit-learn fit, a transformers training step, etc.) and
return the metrics dict that matters to you. The Leoflow contract is the
same: each parameter receives its upstream's return value; a fan-in parameter
receives the list of all upstream return values (issue #257 / xcom_input_many).
