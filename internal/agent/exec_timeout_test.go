// the standard library's copying goroutine reads until every writer closes it.
// Killing the direct shell alone therefore does not end the wait.
//
// The loop is self-limiting (400 × 0.05s ≈ 20s) so a regression fails the

// and it appends a byte per iteration so a test can see whether the work is
