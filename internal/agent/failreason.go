import "errors"

// Operator-facing classifications for the failures the RUNNER diagnoses itself,
// after registration. They are the same shape, and exist for the same reason, as
// the pre-registration set in bootstrap.go: a CLOSED set of constants, because
// the reason they produce is written to the container termination message, is
// read back by the reconciler as the durable outcome record's Reason, and is then
// served to end users on the task-instance API. Interpolating an error into one
// of them would turn that field into an exfiltration path for credentials,
// internal endpoints, and TLS handshake detail, so no call site ever does.
//
// A failure with no constant here is deliberately UNCLASSIFIED: the record then
// carries no reason at all and the reconciler renders the exit code, which is
// strictly better than putting raw error text on a durable, end-user-visible
// field. Add a constant when there is real guidance to give.

// It reads only the error's IDENTITY (an errors.Is against a sentinel), never its
// message, so the result is always one of the constants above or the empty string.
// The unrecognized cases matter as much as the recognized ones: the XCom fetch
// wraps a raw gRPC error that can carry the control-plane endpoint and TLS
// handshake text, and the per-attempt TMPDIR failure carries a filesystem path.
// Both stay unclassified, so neither reaches the durable record.
