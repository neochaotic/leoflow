// WarmRunner is the client side of the warm-worker transport (ADR 0058 D4): a
// long-lived process that registers once, opens the AwaitAssignment bidi stream,
// and serves MANY task attempts — one at a time — each in a fresh forked child.
//
// Two identities are kept deliberately separate:
//
//   - StreamClient carries the worker's BOOTSTRAP identity. Register and the
//     AwaitAssignment control stream run on it and never adopt an attempt token,
//     so the pod's membership in the pool is stable for the worker's whole life.
//   - WorkClient carries each attempt's PER-ATTEMPT identity. Its per-RPC
//     credential reads AttemptTokens, which the loop swaps to the assignment's
//     attempt_token before running. Because attempts are strictly sequential, no
//     two attempts' RPCs are ever in flight at once, so the swap is race-free; and
//     because the swap only touches AttemptTokens (a different TokenSource / dial
//     from the stream), it never disturbs the already-open bootstrap stream, whose
//     authorization header was sent once at stream open.
//
// In production StreamClient and WorkClient are two dials of the same control
// plane (see cmd/leoflow-agent), one bound to the bootstrap TokenSource and one to
// AttemptTokens. They may be the same client only in tests that don't exercise the
// credential.
