// Scope gating (ADR 0058 D2) — the security guarantee that a warm worker's
// bootstrap credential authorizes ONLY the control channel and can never resolve
// secrets or a task. It is enforced per-RPC, right after identify(), so a
// leaked or forged warm-worker token that reaches a secret/task handler is
// rejected before it touches the vault, the task spec, or XCom.
//
// The two credentials are disjoint by scope:
//   - a warm-worker token (Scope == auth.ScopeWarmWorker) is accepted ONLY on
//     Register + AwaitAssignment (the control channel) and PermissionDenied on
//     every secret/task RPC (requireAttemptToken);
//   - a task ("attempt") token (Scope == "") is accepted on every secret/task RPC
//     as before and PermissionDenied on AwaitAssignment (requireWarmWorkerToken).
//
// Register accepts both: warm workers and task pods both register.

// requireAttemptToken rejects a warm-worker-scoped credential on a secret/task
// RPC. A warm worker's control-channel token must never resolve secrets, the task
// spec, or XCom, nor report/heartbeat a task — those are the per-attempt token's
// sole province (delivered in-band over WorkAssignment). Returns nil for a task
// token (the default scope), leaving today's behavior unchanged.
