// TestAwaitAssignmentEndsOnShutdown pins the warm-pool half of the eviction bug
// class. An idle warm worker holds its assignment stream open indefinitely — that
// is the whole point of the transport — so without a shutdown signal the bounded
// graceful stop waits its full budget on every single shutdown: the forced path
// becomes the normal path and the "graceful stop exceeded its bound" warning
// fires every time, which destroys its value as a signal. The handler must end
// the stream itself when the control plane starts shutting down, with the same
// Unavailable the log stream uses so the worker treats it as a transient stream
// end and reconnects toward the surviving replica.
