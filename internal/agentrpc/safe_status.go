// detailInternal is the phrase an agent receives in place of a control-plane
// failure's own text.
//
// The task pod is a trust boundary. It runs the tenant's own image and
// entrypoint, so every gRPC status message is text handed to authenticated,
// tenant-controlled code that can call TaskSpec, GetVariables or GetXCom in a
// loop. A repository error normally wraps a driver error, and pgconn renders a
// *pgconn.PgError as "severity: message (SQLSTATE code)" with the constraint,
// table and column names of our schema inside the message; a *pgconn.ConnectError
// renders the database user and name. Echoing either into the pod is schema
// disclosure (CWE-209). RecoveryUnaryInterceptor already collapses a panic to a
// constant for exactly this audience; this is the same rule applied to the
// failures the handlers themselves see.

// safeMessage returns the phrase Leoflow composed for this failure, or fallback
// when the error carries no such phrase.
//
// The default is deny. Only a domain.SafeError — an error someone deliberately
// wrote as client-facing — contributes text to a status message; everything
// else, including every fmt.Errorf wrap of a driver error, is replaced. A newly
// introduced storage error therefore cannot leak by omission: it leaks only if
// someone rewrites it as a SafeError, the one construct whose GoDoc says its
// message is shown verbatim.

//
// op is a constant written at the call site, never derived from an error, so
// the agent's own log — the one an operator reads in the task's output — still
// says WHICH step failed. Over-redaction is a real regression: a task that
// fails with no usable reason costs the person debugging the DAG more than the
// disclosure costs the tenant.

// the log stays at warn, so an ordinary pod kill does not manufacture an error
