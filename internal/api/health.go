// this binary requires. *storage.Postgres implements it; Redis and other
// schema-less dependencies do not, and keep the Ping-only contract.
//
// It exists because a Ping is not evidence of a usable database (#1023). The
// invariant is enforced at boot, where the server refuses to start against a
// database whose schema_migrations is absent or behind — but a boot check says
// nothing about a database that changes UNDER a running pod, which is exactly
// what an ephemeral-volume recycle, a restore from an older backup, a failover
// to a lagging replica, or a repointed database.url does.

// probeBudget bounds the WHOLE readiness handler, not one step of it, so a

// (the chart's probes.readiness.timeoutSeconds default is 3s; the chart refuses
// to render a value that does not leave room for this one — see
// leoflow.readinessTimeoutSeconds). Overrunning it turns a probe that should
// report "not ready" into a probe that reports nothing at all, and a probe that
// reports nothing writes no log line naming the dependency, which is the
// diagnostic the #1023 fix exists to provide.
//
// It is one deadline shared by every step because a per-step allowance is not a
// budget: bounding the schema query at 2s while leaving Ping unbounded, once per
// dependency, made the handler's worst case Ping(pg) + 2s + Ping(redis) with the
// Pings limited only by whatever the kubelet allowed (#1040). Sharing it means
// the last dependency checked gets what the earlier ones left, which is the
// honest accounting: the caller's timeout is a property of the request, not of
// each thing the request happens to touch.

//
// Scoped to the CHECKS MAP, and only that. /api/v2/monitor/health also reports a
// scheduler heartbeat, and that path is outside this budget: Heartbeat() takes
// no context, derives its own from context.Background() and carries its own
// hardcoded bound, so that endpoint's worst case is this budget plus the
// heartbeat's. It is a dashboard rather than a probe, so nothing routes on it —

//
// The distinction is operational, not cosmetic. The schema check reports through
// a single error, but it answers two questions: "the schema is wrong" and "I
// could not read the schema". A deadline exceeded against the handler's own 2s
// bound, a reset connection, an exhausted pool — all arrive here as a non-nil
// error from the schema call, and calling those "schema not current" points
// whoever is paged at the migration Job for a connectivity problem. The runbook
// makes that exact string a PASS criterion, so conflating them would also make
// the release check pass for the wrong reason.
//
// A third question appeared when the probe moved to ONE budget shared by every
// dependency: "nobody said no, we just ran out of time". Under a shared budget
// the check that fails is whichever one happened to be running when the budget
// expired, not the one that consumed it — a Postgres eating 1.8s of a 2s budget
// leaves Redis 200ms, so Redis times out and a healthy Redis takes the blame.
// Reporting that as "redis unavailable" is the same wrong-dependency page this
// whole line of work exists to prevent, so a deadline is reported as a deadline
// and the dependency that actually spent the budget is named instead.
//
// All three remain 503, and all three remain vague on purpose: /readyz is
// unauthenticated (probes carry no token) and the raw error can carry a DSN,
// credentials or an internal hostname (audit H2), so the real cause is logged
// server-side and the response names only the dependency. A dependency name and
