// ObservabilityHandler builds the handler served on the metrics listener: the
// Prometheus /metrics endpoint plus the same /healthz and /readyz the full API
// exposes (reusing the very same handlers, so the semantics are identical —
// trivial liveness, dependency-pinging readiness).
//
// Roles that do not serve the full API — the ADR 0049 scheduler role — still need
// a liveness/readiness surface for the kubelet's probes. The metrics listener runs
// in every role, so mounting health here gives a scheduler-only pod a probe target
// without exposing the API, auth, or UI. The full API keeps its own /healthz and
// /readyz on the HTTP port, so the "all" role is unchanged; this is purely
// additive on the metrics port.
//
// This handler is intentionally unauthenticated (probes carry no token) and does
// not run the API middleware chain; it is the same trust level as scraping
// /metrics, which is already public.
