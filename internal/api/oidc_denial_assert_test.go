// This file holds the two assertions every OIDC login test funnels through, and
// the tests OF those assertions.
//
// They are tested rather than trusted because a refused login and a successful
// one are now the same status code. `rec.Code == http.StatusFound` used to mean
// the login worked; it no longer does, so the difference between the two lives
// entirely inside these helpers. A helper that cannot fail would make every
// caller a test that cannot fail, silently, all at once.

// bareRedirectBody is the body net/http writes for a redirect answered to a GET:
// one anchor naming the target, and nothing else. Deriving it here, instead of
// probing the body for a handful of suspicious words, is what makes the body
// assertion a detector: ANY reason smuggled into the body, in any wording, is a
// byte that is not in this string.

// takes no channel to the browser at all.

// loginDenialProblems reports everything wrong with a response that is supposed
// to be a refused single sign-on. It returns findings instead of failing so the
// rules themselves can be exercised: see TestLoginDenialProblems.
//
// The shape is a redirect to the login page, not problem+json. Both OIDC routes
// are reached only by a top-level browser navigation, so JSON reached the user
// as a page of raw text with no way back to the sign-in page. What has to hold
// in every case:
//
//   - no session is minted. This is the security property; the rest is UX.
//   - the browser is sent to the login page, and to this origin. A deny that
//     could be steered off-origin would be an open redirect on the one path that
//     runs before anything is authenticated.
//   - the response carries no reason, in the target, in the body, or in a
//     header. The cause goes to the audit row and the server log; telling the
//     browser why a login was refused tells whoever is probing the deployment
//     the same thing.
