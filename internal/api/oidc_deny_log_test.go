// TestEveryDenyReachesTheLog is the diagnosability half of the SSO audit.

// lives in a Postgres table reachable only through an API that needs a working
// session, and with provider: oidc and an empty break-glass list there is no
// session to be had. So the one channel an operator can actually read carried
