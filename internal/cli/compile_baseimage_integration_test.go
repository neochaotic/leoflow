// This file closes the wiring half of the DAG base-image pin. baseImageRef is
// unit-tested as a pure function (compile_build_baseimage_test.go), but nothing
// asserted that a REAL binary, stamped the way a release stamps it, actually
// emits the pinned FROM — and the version stamp is precisely what selects the
// branch:
//
//	a clean release version  → ghcr.io/…/leoflow-runtime:py<ver>-v<X.Y.Z>  (immutable)
//	a dev/dirty/describe one → ghcr.io/…/leoflow-runtime:py<ver>           (moving)
//
// The gap was not merely "untested": it was untestable by accident. Every test
// binary and every `go build` reports version "dev", so an in-process test of
// the compile chain can only ever observe the moving branch, and the k3d e2es
// hand `compile` their own Dockerfile (`--dockerfile Dockerfile`, FROM a
// locally-built base), so they never reach generatedDockerfile at all. Which
// branch the toolchain exercised therefore depended on how far main had drifted
// from the last tag — `make build` stamps `git describe`, so on the tag commit
// the pinned branch ran and one commit later the moving one did, silently
// alternating (#1032).
//
// The failure that would have shipped: a released CLI resolving the MOVING tag.
// Users get a base image that changes under them between releases, which
// defeats the immutability that makes a base bump safe to ship in a patch —
// and every existing signal stays green, because the unit test tests the
// function and the e2e may be exercising the other branch that week.
//
// So the stamping is not a detail of the setup, it IS the subject. Anything
// here that skips it tests nothing while looking like it tests everything: an
// unstamped binary yields the moving tag for EVERY case, so the moving
// assertion passes for the wrong reason and reads as proof that we never pin.
// assertVersionStamp exists to make that state impossible to mistake for a pass.

// publishedRuntimeRepo is spelled out rather than read from publishedBaseRepo so
// this test pins the observable contract — the repository release.yaml actually
// pushes tags to — instead of agreeing with the constant whatever it becomes.

// TestCompileFromPinsReleaseBaseImage drives the whole chain — link-time version

//
// Both branches are asserted so neither can silently become the other, which is
// the actual regression risk: the two are one `if` apart, and a mistake in
// either direction is invisible in a diff review and invisible in CI.
//
// No cluster and no registry: a builder shim copies the Dockerfile the CLI told
// it to build, which is the only artifact under test. That keeps this in the
