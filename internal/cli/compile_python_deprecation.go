// warnDeprecatedPython prints a one-time warning when the base image this

//
// It runs at compile, not at task boot. The choice matters: the author picking
// `python_version` is the only person who can change it, and compile is the
// moment they make the choice, with the file open. A warning from the agent in
// the task pod would reach the operator instead — who cannot edit the DAG's
// leoflow.yaml — and would repeat on every task of every run of every DAG,
// which is how a real warning becomes log noise people filter out. A build-time
// warning inside runtime/Dockerfile was the third option and is weaker still:
// it only fires for people who build the base from a source checkout, which is
// nobody on the path this deprecation is about (they pull the published tag).
//
// Nothing here fails the compile — not even a failed write to w. The line is
// still published, still pulls, and still works; the point is to reach the
// author months before it stops being rebuilt, not to break them today. A
// compile that produced a correct dag.json must not exit non-zero because a
// closed pipe swallowed an advisory.
//
// Two populations get the warning, and each gets its own headline and its own
// remedy:
//   - the default path, where base_image is unset and the FROM is derived from
//     python_version;
//   - an explicit base_image that pins one of OUR published deprecated tags,
//     which is the population the deprecation is actually about — a pin is what
//     keeps a user on a frozen base after we stop publishing it.
//
// An explicit base_image pointing anywhere else is somebody else's image and
// gets no warning, even when python_version is set: the field is unused for the
// FROM in that case, and nagging about it would train people to ignore this.
