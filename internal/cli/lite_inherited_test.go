// TestAnnounceReadyInheritedDags covers the visible half of #1104. `leoflow dev`
// keeps its state under ~/.leoflow/dev and nothing resets it, so a DAG
// registered during a spike weeks ago is still registered: it schedules, it
// fires, it fails, and it fails inside a session that has nothing to do with it.
//
// The banner is where the fix belongs. The leftovers are invisible until one of
// them breaks, and someone who does not know they exist will not go looking for
// a flag to remove them — so the count has to arrive unasked, in the block
// already carrying the URL, the login and the project path.
