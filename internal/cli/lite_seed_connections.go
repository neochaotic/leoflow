// connectionsToSeed decides which of a DAG's declared connections Lite may take
// from the environment, and reports the ones it refused and why (#1103).
//
// Registration is fail-closed against the vault: a DAG declaring a connection
// the vault does not hold is rejected, with a message naming the fix. In Lite
// that produces a second declaration of the same value, because the subprocess
// executor inherits the environment and connections reach tasks as
// AIRFLOW_CONN_<ID> — so the developer has already exported the connection for
// the task to consume, and must then write it again for registration to pass.
//
// Taking a secret from ambient environment is only defensible under conditions,
// and they are the reason this is a separate, testable decision rather than a
// loop inlined at the call site:
//
//   - DECLARED ONLY. Anything AIRFLOW_CONN_* that the DAG did not declare is
//     ignored. Seeding whatever happens to be exported would copy unrelated
//     credentials out of a developer's shell into a database.
//   - THE VAULT WINS. A connection already stored is never replaced, so a stale
//     export cannot shadow a value somebody set deliberately.
//   - UNUSABLE IS REPORTED, NOT STORED. A URI that does not parse is skipped
//     with its name, never its value: storing garbage would replace "this
//     connection is missing", which registration says clearly, with a
//     connection that exists and fails inside the task.
//   - LITE ONLY. Enforced by the caller — this runs from `leoflow dev`, which
//     is the unsandboxed dev loop, and has no path into a Pro control plane.
//
// lookup is the environment accessor (os.Getenv in production), injected so the
// decision is testable without mutating the process environment.
