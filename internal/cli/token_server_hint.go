// The config stores `server_url` and `token` together — internal/config/persist.go
// writes both keys in the same call — so the CLI has always known which server it
// minted a token for. It just never said so: pointing a command at another server
// with --server carried the persisted token along, that server rejected it, and
// the user saw a 401 with no way to tell an expired token from a token that
// belongs somewhere else (#1102).
//
// It stays silent in every case where a mismatch is not what happened: a non-401,
// a token the user supplied explicitly, no config server to compare against, or
// two spellings of the same server. A hint that fires when nothing is wrong sends
// people chasing the wrong thing, which is worse than the bare 401 it replaces.
//
// This decorates the error rather than being a new pattern: hintEmailUsername
// already does the same for the login flow's 401.
