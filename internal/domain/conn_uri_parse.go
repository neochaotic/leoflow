// ParseConnectionURI reads an Airflow connection URI — the AIRFLOW_CONN_<ID>
// form a task consumes — back into a Connection.
//
// It is the inverse of the URI the control plane delivers to tasks, and it
// follows Airflow's own from_uri semantics wherever the two could differ,
// because the value being parsed is one the user wrote for Airflow to read:
//
//   - the scheme carries `-` where the conn_type has `_` (google_cloud_platform
//     and friends are not legal URI schemes), so it is reversed here exactly as
//     the emitter applies it;
//   - userinfo is percent-decoded into login and password;
//   - the path becomes the schema with ONE leading slash removed, which is what
//     Airflow does — note this is lossy for an absolute path like sqlite's
//     `sqlite:///tmp/db`, whose schema comes back as `tmp/db`. Matching Airflow
//     is the right loss to take: the task resolves the connection through
//     Airflow, so Airflow's reading is the meaning;
//   - `__extra__` carries the JSON blob, as the emitter writes it.
//
// No error returned here ever contains the URI: the value is a credential, and
// an error is the most likely thing to be logged, wrapped or printed. Errors
// name the connection and the problem.
//
// An empty conn_type is refused. A connection with no type cannot be delivered
// to a task in a form Airflow will accept, so storing one would replace a
// missing connection with a broken one.
