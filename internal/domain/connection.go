// ConnectionPatch is a tri-state write to a Connection (#887). Each nullable
// field is one of three states the write path must keep distinct:
//   - nil pointer   -> absent: preserve the stored value (the upsert passes NULL
//     and COALESCE keeps the current column).
//   - non-nil ""    -> present and empty: clear the field to empty.
//   - non-nil value -> present: set the field.
//
// A plain string cannot carry "absent" vs "present and empty", which is why the
// safe-merge upsert alone (v0.4.4) could neither clear a field nor stop a
// round-tripped mask from overwriting a secret. ConnType is always written
// (required on every upsert). Secret-mask handling (the mask means "unchanged")
// is resolved by the caller before it builds the patch, so the repository only
// ever sees the three states above.
