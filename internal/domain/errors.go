// ErrSchemaNotCurrent is returned when the database is reachable but its
// migration state is not one the running binary can serve. It lives here, next
// to the other cross-cutting sentinels, because two layers need to agree on it:
// storage produces the verdict, and the health endpoints must tell it apart
// from "the database could not be read at all". Both answers are a 503, but one
// sends an operator to the migration Job and the other to the connection pool,
// and a probe that conflates them costs an on-call hour.
var ErrSchemaNotCurrent = errors.New("database schema is not current")
