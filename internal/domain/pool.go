// Pool is a named, tenant-scoped, cross-DAG task-concurrency budget (Airflow's
// pool). Slots is the cap: a task in the pool is admitted to `queued` only while
// the pool has a free slot, counting queued+running task instances across every
// DAG (ADR 0053 Stage 3). IsDefault marks the implicit default_pool a task with
// no declared pool falls back to. Pools are a Pro-only concept.
