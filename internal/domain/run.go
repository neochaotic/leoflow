	// recorded by whichever component observed it: the agent's own report, the
	// reconciler reading the pod (image pull, OOM, exit code), a reaper declaring
	// the pod or agent lost, or the agent's pre-registration classification. It is
	// the answer to "why did this fail?" for an attempt that streamed no logs
	// because its agent never started — the case where the only remaining source
	// of truth used to be `kubectl logs` against the cluster.
	//
	// It is best-effort and often empty: a healthy instance has none, and a cause
	// nobody observed cannot be invented. It carries a classification, never a
	// credential or a raw internal error.
