// masks values of secret-ish keys.

// VariablePatch is a tri-state write to a Variable (#887). Description mirrors
// domain.ConnectionPatch: nil preserves the stored value (COALESCE), non-nil ""
// clears, and a value sets. Value is subtly different because the `value` column
// is NOT NULL: the caller resolves an omitted or masked ("***" for a sensitive
// key) value to the stored value BEFORE building the patch, so Value is expected
// non-nil here — a non-nil "" still clears. Key is always written.
