// Only Kubernetes apiserver error types can yield the Backpressure verdict; every
// other error is Rejected, which preserves today's path exactly for the Lite
// subprocess executor — its errors are never apiserver StatusErrors, so its
// dispatch handling is unreachable by the Backpressure branch (ADR 0053).
//
// The two backpressure signals:
//   - 429 Too Many Requests: API Priority & Fairness shed the request. Always
//     transient.
//   - 403 Forbidden carrying the ResourceQuota admission plugin's "exceeded
//     quota" marker: the namespace quota is full. Transient — it clears as the
//     namespace's running pods complete.
//
// A 403 Forbidden WITHOUT the quota marker is an RBAC denial: permanent, and
// deliberately not conflated with quota (apierrors.IsForbidden covers both — the
// message is the only discriminator). An admission-webhook rejection ("denied the
// request") also arrives as Forbidden and is likewise treated as permanent: a
// webhook that rejects a spec rejects every re-offer of that same spec, so
// retrying forever would loop silently — a bounded retry surfaces it as
// dispatch_failed instead. A genuinely transient webhook (call timeout under a
// Fail policy) is not special-cased; it falls to the permanent default, matching
// today's behavior, rather than risking an infinite re-offer loop on a poison
// spec.

// "exceeded quota: <name>, requested: ...", while an RBAC denial reads "... cannot
// create resource ...", which lacks the marker. The caller gates this on
// IsForbidden, so a non-apiserver error whose text merely mentions quota can
// never reach it.
