// podStartupHeadroom is how much longer than the declared execution timeout the
// pod's deadline runs, to absorb everything that happens between the two clocks
// that bound a task.
//
// The two clocks start at different moments. The kubelet counts
// activeDeadlineSeconds from pod.Status.StartTime, which is stamped BEFORE the
// image pull; the agent starts its own deadline inside its execute step, AFTER
// the RUNNING pre-flight report, source staging and venv resolution. With the
// deadline set to the timeout itself the kubelet wins by the entire startup
// cost — systematically, on every task, not as a race.
//
// That inversion matters because of the layering: the AGENT owns the semantic
// timeout. It is what interrupts the user process at the boundary the author
// declared and reports "execution_timeout: task exceeded Xs limit", the only
// description that tells an operator a task was killed for running too long.
// The kubelet's deadline is only the backstop for an agent that can no longer
// enforce anything (crashed, wedged, partitioned), so it must never fire first:
// when it does, the pod is gone and the reason degrades to what Kubernetes
// observed from outside (see podFailureReason), which cannot name a timeout.
//
// The value is the dispatch-lost threshold, which is this project's own bound on
// how long a healthy task may take to go from queued to RUNNING: pod creation,
// scheduling, image pull, staging-volume mount, agent boot, secret resolution
// and the RUNNING pre-flight round trip. Below that the control plane still
// treats the task as healthily starting up, so the kubelet must not yet be
// spending the user's execution budget on it. Reusing the threshold keeps the
// two judgments of "still starting" from drifting apart.
//
// The termination grace is added on top of this rather than folded into it: the
// grace covers the tail (the agent shutting the child down and delivering its
// report after its own deadline fired), the headroom covers the head. Either
// alone leaves the kubelet able to preempt.
//
// A fixed headroom is not airtight, deliberately: a pathological image pull
// (cold node, multi-gigabyte image, a throttling registry) or a control-plane
// outage spanning the RUNNING pre-flight (which retries without a budget, by
// design) exceeds any constant, and then the kubelet fires first again and the
// timeout diagnosis is lost. The airtight variant is to anchor the AGENT's
// clock at process start instead of at execute, which makes it strictly earlier
// than the kubelet's for any non-negative headroom. That is not done here
// because it would fold staging and venv resolution into the author's declared
// budget, changing what execution_timeout means (it covers task execution).
const podStartupHeadroom = defaultDispatchLostThreshold

// podActiveDeadline returns the task pod's ActiveDeadlineSeconds: the user's
// declared timeout plus startup headroom and termination grace when set,
// otherwise the attempt credential ceiling as a floor, otherwise 0 (no
// deadline). The user's value is never shortened — a declared timeout is the
// author's bound to make, even one above the ceiling — and it is never merely
// matched either: the deadline outlasts it so the agent's own clock fires first
// and the operator sees the timeout named (podStartupHeadroom).
//
// The floor path takes no headroom. It is not a bound the agent races: nothing
// in the pod enforces the credential ceiling from inside, so there is no earlier
// clock to leave room for, and extending the pod past the ceiling only buys time
// in which its lapsed bearer can accomplish nothing.
//
// The floor exists because the agent's RUNNING and terminal reports retry for as
// long as the control plane is unreachable (by design: a report that gives up is
// how a succeeded task ends up marked failed), so a pod with no deadline of its
// own would survive a total control-plane outage indefinitely, pinned Running
// with its requests held and blocking node scale-down. Past the credential
// ceiling the pod can do nothing useful — its bearer stops renewing and lapses —
// so that is the natural bound; a non-positive ceiling is the operator's "no
// ceiling" and applies no floor. When the pod hits the floor the kubelet kills
// it and the reconciler recovers the durable outcome record the agent wrote
// before its first report attempt, so no result is lost, only a stuck pod.

// pod can outlive the timeout its author declared by about two hours. The
// backstop has to stay a backstop.
//
// The term is capped rather than dropped because the tail it budgets is real:
// once the agent's own clock fires it still has to stop the child, write the
// durable outcome record and land one report RPC, and the kubelet must not
// preempt that. But the tail is not proportional to the declared grace. The
// agent does not pass the declaration on to the child: internal/agent/exec.go
// runs it under exec.CommandContext with the default cancel, an immediate
