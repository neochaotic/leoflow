// orphan reaper failed the whole run (#527). Invoked once per scheduler tick,
// leader-only. Mirrors the other reapers' resilience: panic-safe, per-candidate
// isolated, metered.
//
// It is Kubernetes-ONLY. With no PodManager (Lite/subprocess) there is no pod to
// lose and a subprocess task legitimately has none, so the reaper is a no-op —
// it must never reap live subprocess work on a "no pod" signal.
//
// Warm-pool attempts are out of this reaper's scope: a warm attempt has no
// per-task pod, so it never appears live here; the warm-worker-lost reaper
// recovers those from the warm pod's own liveness. That signal is one a
// control-plane restart cannot manufacture — ListWarmPods is a live apiserver
// LIST (not an informer-backed cache that could be cold or stale after a
// restart), and a LIST error aborts its tick with zero marks, so a fresh leader
// either sees the real warm fleet or marks nothing — yet the reaper is held by
// the same leader-settling gate as every other one: the delay is harmless and
// one uniform gate is the point.
