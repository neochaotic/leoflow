// PodManager is the slice of the Kubernetes executor the reapers use to (1)
// tear down a reaped task's pod and (2) check whether a queued TI's pod is
// actually live before declaring its dispatch lost (#474, #461).
//
// Before #474 the reapers only wrote DB state, so a reaped TI's pod kept
// running to completion — breaking at-most-once execution. The reapers now
// call these AFTER the durable DB transition so the pod is actually stopped.
//
// It is nil in Lite/subprocess, where tasks are host processes with no pods.
// Every call site guards the nil: a nil PodManager means "no pods to manage",
// and the dispatch-lost reaper falls back to its pure time-threshold behavior.
//
// The Kubernetes executor implements this; the interface lives here so the
// scheduler depends on a capability, not on the executor package.

// The distinction is load-bearing, not cosmetic. A bare bool collapsed the last
// two states, and the pod-lost reaper read that collapse as authorization to
// reap: for a task pod that had already finished it marked the task instance
// pod_lost and then DELETED the pod — destroying the termination-log evidence
// the reconciler recovers the task's durable outcome from. A finished task then
// reads as failed, and its run with it. Presence must be three-valued so a
// reaper can defer on "present but finished" while still reaping on a genuine
// absence, which is the state pod-lost exists for.
