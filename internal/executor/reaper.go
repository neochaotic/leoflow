// A control-plane restart manufactures the very signals the reapers act on: a
// stale heartbeat (the receiver was down), a task pod that exited during the
// outage (its terminal report found no server), a run with no recent activity.
// Each reaper used to carry its own post-leadership grace; that closes the race
// per reaper and leaves the class open — the reaper cadence and the reconciler
// cadence were independent clocks, so a grace tuned against one sweep interval
// still allowed zero completed sweeps. One gate over the observable facts (the
// sweep DID complete; the cache IS synced; the fleet HAD a grace to re-heartbeat)
// closes the class for every present and future reaper.
//
// Liveness valve: if the leader has not settled after 2 × SettlingGrace (the
// reconciler cannot list pods, the informer never syncs) the gate opens anyway,
// warning and metering reap_settling_valve_open on every cycle it stays open.
// A permanently held gate would trade "reap wrong" for "never reap": stuck runs
// and lost tasks would accumulate silently, which is the failure the reapers
// exist to prevent. By then the reconciler has had at least four cycles, so the
// diagnosis "the sweep is broken" is real, not a scheduling artifact.
//
// Why opening it is safe — the argument the valve rests on. The dominant reason
// a sweep never completes is that the apiserver cannot be read: unreachable,
// unauthorized, throttled. The reconciler's pod LIST and the reapers' own
// pod-presence LIST hit that same apiserver, so the failure that shuts the gate
// also denies every pod-dependent reaper its authorization: pod-lost and
// dispatch-lost defer on a query error, and the warm-worker-lost reaper aborts
// its tick with zero marks. They fail closed on their own, without the gate.
// The gate covers the remaining case — the apiserver answers but no sweep has
// yet run under this leadership — and the valve trades that narrow window for
// not wedging the reapers forever.
//
// The valve must therefore never be the only thing standing between a
// recoverable pod and a destructive reap, because it is designed to open. That
// is why the pod-lost reaper reaps only when the attempt has NO pod object at
// all: a pod that is present but finished stays the reconciler's to settle from
// its termination log, valve open or shut. A reap authorized by presence alone
// cannot be manufactured by any grace, cadence or election timing.
//
// The warm-worker-lost reaper is gated too although its signal (a warm pod's
// own liveness, read by a live LIST that fails closed) is not one a restart
// manufactures: delaying it by the grace is harmless — a dead worker's attempts
// are recovered a little later, and warm-pool REFILL is a separate loop that
// is not gated — and one uniform gate is the point.
//
// Nil inputs are satisfied conditions: Lite wires none of them and must behave
// exactly as before. A zero leadership stamp (not leading) also opens the gate
// here — the destructive gate mayReap owns the not-leading case.
