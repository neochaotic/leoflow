// ResilienceLadder is the set of timing knobs whose relative ORDER the
// control-plane-restart recovery depends on. Each is owned by a different
// package (agent, executor, scheduler, server main, operator config) and tuned
// for its own reason, so nothing but this type states that they must line up.
// The invariants:
//
//	heartbeat interval  <  agent-lost threshold  <  settling grace  <  attempt token TTL
//	2 × maintenance interval  <  settling grace
//	longest infra re-place delay  <  orphan threshold
//	attempt token TTL  <  max attempt credential lifetime   (when the ceiling is enabled)
//
// Why each rung matters:
//   - heartbeat < threshold: a healthy agent must beat well inside the silence
//     window or the agent-lost reaper fails live tasks.
//   - threshold < settling grace: after a (re-)election the reapers wait longer
//     than the silence they punish, so the whole fleet can re-heartbeat.
//   - settling grace < token TTL: the grace ends while a re-heartbeat can still
//     authenticate and renew the bearer; otherwise the fleet is unreapable AND
//     unable to report — every in-flight task is lost.
//   - 2×maintenance < settling grace: the leader's maintenance loop runs the
//     reconciler's sweep and then the reapers as ONE ordered cycle, so a reap
//     structurally follows a completed sweep — the settling gate additionally
//     requires that a sweep completed under the new leader. This rung is what
//     makes the grace meaningful on top of that ordering: at least two whole
//     cycles fit inside it, so a settle that failed transiently on the first
//     sweep (a DB hiccup) is retried before the gate can open, and the liveness
//     valve at 2×grace has seen at least four cycles before it declares the
//     sweep broken. A single cycle is not enough: the first tick under a new
//     leader may land anywhere in the interval, so "one interval below the
//     grace" can mean zero completed cycles.
//   - infra re-place delay < orphan threshold: a run whose only live task is
//     parked in its longest infra re-place backoff has no activity to show the
//     orphan-run reaper; the threshold must outlast that parking or the reaper
//     eats a run that is still recovering from the very fault being retried.
//   - token TTL < credential lifetime: heartbeat renewal keeps an attempt's
//     bearer alive only while the attempt is younger than the ceiling. A ceiling
//     below the TTL means the first renewal is already refused, the bearer
//     lapses at the TTL, and every task longer than one TTL is unreapable AND
//     unable to report — the restart recovery is silently disabled. This is the
//     ONLY operator-tunable rung; every other value is a build-time constant.
//
// Warm pools share the same ladder: a warm worker's per-attempt bearer is renewed
// by the same heartbeat under the same ceiling, and the warm-worker-lost reaper
// reuses the pod-lost mark, so no warm-specific rung exists.
