// with no backing pod — invisible to the pod-lost reaper (a warm attempt has no
// per-task pod) and, until its heartbeat lapses, to the agent-lost reaper. This
// reaper closes that gap: it lists the durably-bound running attempts, reads the
// live warm-pod set once per tick, and for every attempt whose worker is no
// longer live it routes the attempt to infra via MarkTaskPodLost.
//
// Fan-out: a dead worker holding N attempts gets all N marked in the tick,
// because every bound TI names the same (now-absent) worker. The set lookup is
// O(1) per TI, so the reaper is Θ(bound TIs + pools) overall.
//
// Warm-off inertness: with warm pools disabled the lister is nil (empty live
// set) AND no TI ever carries a warm_worker_id (ListWarmBoundRunningTIs returns
// empty), so the reaper is a double no-op — byte-for-byte today. Resilience
