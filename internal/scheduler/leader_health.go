// LeaderHealthReader answers "is a live scheduler leading?" from shared DB state,
// for a process that does NOT run the scheduler itself — the split api role (ADR
// 0049), whose /api/v2/monitor/health must not report a fake-healthy scheduler
// from a nil in-process handle (finding F1). A live scheduler leader holds the
// leadership advisory lock (ADR 0009) on its own session; when its process dies
// the session drops and the lock releases, so lock presence is a real
// cross-process liveness signal with no extra heartbeat table.
//
// It intentionally does NOT filter by pg_backend_pid (that is Leader.HoldsLock's
// job, confirming THIS session's own hold) — here any live holder means a
// scheduler is up. Limitation: it detects a dead/absent leader, not a leader that
// is alive but stalled (lock held, loop wedged); the in-process Heartbeat still
// covers stalls in the all/scheduler role. Tick-accurate cross-process health
// would need a persisted heartbeat (future work).
