// failUndispatchable fails a task that has no executor to run it (pod dispatch
// disabled). The condition is deterministic for the process lifetime, so failing
// fast — with the reason on the task note for the UI — beats leaving the run
// "running" forever (#46, #50).
// handleDispatchFailure records a synchronous dispatch failure: it backs the task
// off for a growing interval, or fails it as dispatch_failed once the attempt
// budget is spent (ADR 0031 Amendment A). It returns nil in both cases — the
// failure is recorded in the DB, not propagated, so one task's dispatch trouble
// does not abort the tick. A dispatch failure is infrastructure, not a task
// failure, so it never consumes the task's try_number.
//
// Cluster backpressure (a ResourceQuota 403 or an APF 429) is split out first
// (ADR 0053): it is retriable-forever, so it is backed off WITHOUT touching the
// dispatch-attempt counter and can never reach the dispatch_failed give-up below.
// Leoflow holds the task and re-offers it until the cluster has room, rather than
// failing the user's task because the cluster asked it to slow down. The
// disposition that split is decided on is classified on the execution layer and
// arrives typed over the seam (ADR 0051 Phase 4), so the scheduler never inspects
// Kubernetes error types itself.

// increment dispatch_attempts — backpressure is a temporary "no room," not a
// poison placement, so it must never accumulate toward the dispatch_failed cap.

// The backoff reuses dispatchBackoff over the task's EXISTING (un-incremented)
// attempt count: a task hitting only backpressure keeps a steady base-interval
// re-offer cadence rather than a growing one — the right trade-off for a
// condition expected to clear, since it recovers fast when the cluster frees room
