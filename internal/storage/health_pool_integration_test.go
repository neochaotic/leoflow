// TestHealthChecksSurviveASaturatedRequestPool pins #1042: readiness must not
// fail because the control plane is busy.
//
// Readiness takes two pool acquires per probe — Ping borrows a connection, the
// schema SELECT borrows another — and both used to come from the pool serving
// requests. Under saturation the probe blocks waiting for a connection and
// fails on its own deadline. Every replica shares that condition, because load
// is what caused it, so they all fail readiness in the same window and the
// Service can empty: a load-induced outage reported as a database problem, and
// one that feeds itself as the pods still in rotation absorb the load of the
// ones that left.
//
// The test saturates the request pool literally — maxOpenConns 1, and the one
// connection held for the duration — and then asserts the probe answers anyway.
// On the pre-fix code both calls block until the deadline and return
// context.DeadlineExceeded.
