// TestLeaderPoolKeepsItsSessionAndItsLock is the regression test for #1199.
//
// The scheduler's advisory lock is SESSION-scoped: it lives and dies with the
// connection holding it. pgxpool.ParseConfig applies a default MaxConnLifetime
// of one hour when the DSN carries no pool_max_conn_lifetime, and leoflow's DSNs
// do not, so the leader pool's one connection was replaced every hour and
// leadership went with it. A 15.7-hour soak recorded 15 step-downs, one per
// hour, in a single process where nothing was contending.
//
// Two things are asserted, because the fix has an obvious wrong form that is
// worse than the bug. The deadline is computed as time.Now().Add(lifetime), so
// setting it to ZERO expires the connection immediately and every Acquire opens
// a new session: that turns an hourly step-down into one per watch tick. A test
// that only asserted "not one hour" would pass on it.
