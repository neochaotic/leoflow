-- Tri-state write (#887): COALESCE(EXCLUDED.col, connections.col) preserves the
-- stored value when the param is NULL, overwrites it when the param is a value,
-- and clears it when the param is a non-NULL empty string. A NULL param is how a
-- partial `set` stays safe — changing only --host must not wipe the (unreadable)
-- password — while an explicit empty string now clears a field, and a masked
-- secret ("***") is mapped to NULL by the caller so it preserves rather than
-- overwrites (#874). conn_type is required on every write, so it is a plain
-- overwrite.
