-- vanished before its first heartbeat is invisible to the agent-lost reaper
-- (its null-heartbeat zero-guard) and to the reconciler (which only sees pods
-- that still exist), so it would sit `running` until the 5-minute orphan reaper.
-- The reaper applies the grace period + a pod-liveness check per candidate in
-- Go, so the SQL stays simple. The LIMIT bounds a single tick's reap work even
-- after a large outage; the rest are picked up next tick.
