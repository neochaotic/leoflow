// two verdicts that cannot drift — but they answer different questions, and for
// `dirty` the answers genuinely differ:
//
//   - Boot asks "may this process START against a half-applied schema?" No: it
//     would run its first query against a table that may be half-migrated.
//   - Readiness asks "should this pod, which was serving correctly a second ago,
//     be pulled out of the Service?" A migration in flight is not a reason to.
//
// Treating run-time dirty as not-ready is an outage, not a conservatism. The
// migrate Job is a `pre-upgrade` Helm hook, so it runs while the OLD pods are
// live and in the Service's endpoints, and golang-migrate commits dirty=true for
// the whole execution of each migration body. Every old replica reads the same
// row, so any migration longer than failureThreshold × periodSeconds (3 × 10s in
// the chart) flips them all NotReady at the same instant and the Service reaches
// zero endpoints. In the "all" role that Service also carries gRPC, so running
// task pods lose the control plane mid-upgrade — the agent_lost cascade (#860).
//
// A failed migration that leaves dirty=true permanently is the same shape: it
// degrades the control plane today, and would remove it from rotation entirely.
//
// Everything else is the boot verdict. An absent or behind schema is not ready:
// no amount of waiting makes this pod able to serve, and it is the #1023 state.
