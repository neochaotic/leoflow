//go:build integration

// Package storage_test — the warm busy-window reliability guard (ADR 0058 N1d-b,
// review finding "Hole A").
//
// BindWarmAttempt stamps warm_worker_id the instant a warm worker ACKs an
// assignment as started, while the TI is still `queued`; the child reports
// RUNNING (queued->running) only a moment later. The old ListBusyWarmWorkerPods
// counted a worker busy ONLY when state='running', so between the ack and the
// RUNNING report the starting worker classified as IDLE — and if that tick had
// len(idle) > EffectiveMinIdle (min_idle lowered, a burst subsiding, a draining
// sibling) the excess-idle-tail delete removed a worker that was actively
// starting an attempt: an M1 violation that kills a just-started attempt.
//
// Two integration cases lock the fix against real Postgres, since both turn on a
// SQL predicate a fake-store unit test cannot prove:
//
//   - The full seam (real busy source + real reconciler): a warm pod bound to a
//     queued (not-yet-running) TI must be classified BUSY and NOT deleted even
//     when the idle target says to scale down. RED before the fix (the pod was
//     deleted — the M1 kill), green after.
//   - The widened busy query + the same-row re-dispatch clear:
//     ListBusyWarmWorkerPods returns a worker for a queued+bound TI, and does NOT
//     return one for a row that was bound then re-dispatched (RequeueForRedispatch
//     cleared warm_worker_id so a stale binding can't falsely mark the gone worker
//     busy).
//
// The shared-DB harness means these rows live alongside whatever else the suite
// seeded, so each test seeds its own uniquely-named DAG/pod and asserts only on
// rows and pod names it owns.
