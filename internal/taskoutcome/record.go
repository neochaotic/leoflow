// Package taskoutcome defines the durable task-outcome record the agent writes to
// its container termination message before delivering the report, and the
// reconciler reads back as the source of truth over pod phase (ADR 0052).
//
// The record decouples a task's true result from the delivery of that result: a
// pod killed mid-report still leaves the outcome behind, so a task that succeeded
// but lost its report is not misread as a failure. The format is a compact,
// versioned JSON document kept far under the Kubernetes termination-message cap;
// it carries the outcome only, never logs or return values.
