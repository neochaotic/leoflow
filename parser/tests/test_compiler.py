    The field exists downstream (dag-schema.json accepts it; the Go DAGSpec
    carries it; EffectiveMinIdle and the scheduler store read it) but has no
    author entry point today: it is absent from the authoring schema
    (leoflow.yaml, additionalProperties:false) and the compiler never writes
    it. So a compiled artifact never carries the key and the Go
    ``spec.MinIdleWorkers`` is always 0. This test locks that inert contract so
    the seam cannot silently become half-wired.

    Even a config that smuggles the key in is dropped: the compiler copies only
    whitelisted config keys, never arbitrary ones.

    When you DO wire author-declared warmth later, this test must change
    deliberately, and the change is not just here — you must ALSO: add
    ``min_idle_workers`` to the authoring schema (leoflow-yaml-schema.json) and
    have the compiler emit it; keep the staging exclusion (a DAG with
    ``staging.enabled`` falls back to a dedicated pod and cannot be warm); and
    lead the operator docs with the safe default (0 = scale-to-zero).
