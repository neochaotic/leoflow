"""Leoflow authoring primitives, available to a ``dag.py`` at RUN time (#17).

This is the twin of ``parser/leoflow_parser/_shim/leoflow``. The two exist for
opposite halves of a DAG's life and must export the same public names:

* the parser shim is on ``sys.path`` only while the compiler parses, is
  dependency-free by ADR 0024, and derives from the parser's own ``airflow``
  shim;
* this one ships in the task image and the Lite per-DAG venv, and derives from
  the real Task SDK.

A ``dag.py`` is not a compile-time-only artifact: ``runner.py`` re-imports the
module for every ``python`` task, so every top-level import in the user's DAG
runs again inside the task pod. Without this package the hybrid shape we
document — ``from leoflow import dbt_group`` over a ``dag.py`` with Python
tasks around the group (ADR 0043) — compiled green and then died on its own
first line with ``ModuleNotFoundError``, in Lite and in Pro alike.

Deriving from the real ``BaseOperator`` is load-bearing, not tidiness:
``pull >> models`` dispatches to the *real* operator's ``__rshift__``, so a
bare stub with its own ``__rshift__`` would never be consulted.
