"""Leoflow task runtime: the helper that runs inside every task container.

It runs the user's Python callable, captures its return value as an XCom, and
exposes upstream XCom inputs. The leoflow-agent invokes ``python -m
leoflow_runtime <module:callable>`` and ships the captured return value back to
the control plane.
