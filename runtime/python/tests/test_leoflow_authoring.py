"""The authoring names a ``dag.py`` imports must resolve inside the TASK image (#17).

A ``dag.py`` is not a compile-time-only artifact. ``runner.py`` re-imports the
module for every ``python`` task — ``importlib.import_module(module_name)`` at
runner.py:135 — so every top-level import in the user's DAG runs again inside
the task pod, and again inside the Lite per-DAG venv.

``leoflow`` was reachable only from ``parser/leoflow_parser/_shim``, which the
compiler puts on ``sys.path`` for the duration of a parse and nowhere else. So
the hybrid shape we document — ``from leoflow import dbt_group`` over a
``dag.py`` with Python tasks around the group (ADR 0043) — compiled green and
then died with ``ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'leoflow'`` on the first
line of the DAG, in Lite and in Pro alike.

Nothing caught it because the only mixed-mode e2e wires BashOperators around the
group, and a bash task never imports ``dag.py``.

These tests run against the REAL task SDK at the version the base image pins, in
a job that installs nothing else — the environment a task pod actually has. An
importorskip here would be worse than no test: it would go green in exactly the
CI where the dependency is absent, which is the CI we have.
