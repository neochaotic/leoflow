# The Airflow UI bundle is pinned twice, and only one of the two is real.
#
#   Makefile AIRFLOW_UI_VERSION   the tag `make fetch-airflow-ui` pulls
#   internal/ui/assets/VERSION    the marker COMMITTED next to the bundle,
#                                 which `ui.Version()` returns at runtime
#
# The marker is the source of truth: it is a byte in the binary, next to the
# SPA the binary serves. The Makefile is intent. Bump the Makefile and forget to
# re-run the target — the most ordinary way this goes wrong, because the target
# needs Docker and a multi-GB pull — and every declaration in the tree says one
# version while the server ships another. Nothing fails: the old bundle keeps
# working, `ui.Version()` keeps answering, and the next person debugging a UI
# behaviour reads the Makefile and compares against the wrong upstream release.
#
# The prose is reconciled too, in the places a reader takes as current truth:
# the `internal/ui` package godoc (which states the pin three times), README.md,
# and docker-compose.yml's comment on the server service.
#
# Deliberately NOT scanned:
#   - internal/api/**, where ~20 DTO godocs name the Airflow release whose
#     response shape they mirror. Those are 20 copies of this same fact, and a
#     UI bump genuinely should revisit them — but mechanically, the useful check
#     is that the SHAPE still matches, and a gate that only demanded the string
#     be rewritten would produce a 20-file sed on every bump for a reviewer to
#     wave through. That is the rubber-stamp failure this class of gate exists
#     to avoid, so it stays a human step; this gate's header is where the next
#     bump reads that it is one.
#   - website/content/project/** and CHANGELOG.md, which are records of their
#     own era (ADRs are immutable — CLAUDE.md).
#   - scripts/connectors-providers*.txt, whose `apache-airflow==` pin happens to
#     match today but governs the provider package set, not the SPA.
#
