# Fail a PR that changes shipped behavior without recording it in the CHANGELOG.
#
# Leoflow keeps a hand-written Keep-a-Changelog `CHANGELOG.md`; entries are added
# manually under `## [Unreleased]` and `cut-release.sh` dates that section at a GA.
# Nothing forced an entry per PR, so features repeatedly merged with none and had
# to be back-filled by separate "docs(changelog): record …" PRs (#529, #532, #708,
# #739, #756, #780, #781, #888 — at least eight). Each wastes a cycle and risks a
# release shipping an incomplete changelog (v0.4.4's headline #881 nearly did).
#
# This gate passes when a PR's `[Unreleased]` section differs from the base
# branch's — i.e. the PR added/changed a changelog entry. Pure-mechanics PRs that
# legitimately have no user-facing change (release-prep, chore, dependabot,
# docs-only) carry the `skip-changelog` label, which the CI job honors before
# invoking this script.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/check-changelog-entry.sh [base-ref]   # default: origin/main
#   scripts/check-changelog-entry.sh --self-test
