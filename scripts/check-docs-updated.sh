# Fail a PR that changes user-facing surface without touching the docs site.
#
# The CHANGELOG gate exists because entries "repeatedly merged with none and had
# to be back-filled by separate PRs (at least eight)". The docs are in exactly
# that state, and it is not hypothetical: taskPodSecurity.readOnlyRootFilesystem
# — the security hardening of the v0.4.5 tranche — shipped in rc.3 with ZERO
# mentions anywhere in website/content/. It was validated on a real cluster the
# same day and nobody noticed, because nothing looks.
#
# "User-facing surface" is deliberately narrow, so the gate is about capability,
# not churn: a chart value an operator sets, the authoring schema a user writes,
# and the CLI commands they run. Internal refactors do not trip it.
#
# Escape hatch: the `skip-docs` label, for PRs that genuinely change nothing a
# user could discover — release prep, dependabot, pure internals. Same shape as
# skip-changelog, and the workflow re-runs on label so it takes effect at once.
#
# Usage: scripts/check-docs-updated.sh <base-ref>   e.g. origin/main
#        scripts/check-docs-updated.sh --self-test
