# Companion gate: scripts/check-migrate-cli-build-tags.sh reconciles
# deploy/Dockerfile.migrate's pin against security.yaml's GO_VERSION, which this
# gate in turn reconciles against go.mod. That file is covered here directly too
# (both its ARG default and its `golang:` literal), so the two overlap rather
# than depend on each other — but if you change either, read the other.
#
# The Go toolchain Leoflow builds with is stated in eleven places. Until #1036 it
# said three different things: `toolchain go1.26.6` in go.mod, `1.26.3` in
# runtime/Dockerfile's GO_VERSION default, `1.26.4` in the Makefile's chaos
# pin, and `golang:1.27-bookworm` in deploy/Dockerfile.server after a Dependabot
# bump touched the one file with a literal tag.
#
# Nothing was broken by that, and that is the point. CI and release both pass
# their own literal, so the published artifacts were consistent; the drift only
# bit `make runtime-images` and `make chaos-dogfood-docker`, which nobody
# releases. What it did do is make every one of the four a false premise for the
# next reader — three people read three different files today and reasoned
# correctly to three different conclusions about which toolchain ships.
#
# Same shape as check-lite-prepull-matches-compose.sh: two copies of a version
# string with nothing between them. The source of truth here is go.mod's
# `toolchain` line, because it is the one the `go` command itself honors — every
# other copy exists to make some other tool agree with it.
#
# The prose is reconciled too, not just the declarations. security.yaml's
# comment argued at length about `golang:1.27-bookworm` being the right pin
# while go.mod said 1.26.6; a comment that asserts a version the tree does not
# use outlives every defect, because nothing tests it.
#
# Deliberately out of scope: prose in website/ and CHANGELOG.md. A released
# changelog section naming its own era's toolchain is a record, not drift, and
# the docs speak in major.minor ("Go 1.26") where this gate reconciles a patch.
