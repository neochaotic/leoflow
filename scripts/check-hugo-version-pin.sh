# The Hugo the PR gate builds with must be the Hugo the deploy publishes with.
#
# website-build.yml (per-PR) and website-deploy.yml (on merge) each declare their
# own `HUGO_VERSION` and each interpolates it into the SAME download URL:
#
#   https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/download/v${HUGO_VERSION}/hugo_extended_${HUGO_VERSION}_linux-amd64.deb
#
# Two copies of a version string with nothing between them. If they drift, the
# PR gate validates a site the deploy never builds — a Docsy shortcode, a
# template function or a config key that works in one Hugo and not the other
# passes review and then breaks production, and the diagnostic arrives on `main`
# rather than on the PR that caused it.
#
# #1036 first skipped this on three grounds, and review took all three apart:
# the copies are in adjacent files but not adjacent lines; hugo.toml's
# `module.hugoVersion.min` is a FLOOR, a different relation this gate can
# declare out of scope the same way the Go gate scopes out prose; and "it fails
# loudly on the next deploy" is the argument the golangci-lint pin gate already
# rejected, because failing on the deploy is failing in the wrong place.
#
# The floor is checked too, but only as a floor: a pin BELOW the minimum the site
# config demands is a configuration that cannot build, and that is worth catching
# here rather than in a Hugo error message.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/check-hugo-version-pin.sh
#   scripts/check-hugo-version-pin.sh --self-test
