# Leoflow Lite starts a Postgres container from docker-compose.dev.yaml, and
# then TELLS the user which one, in prose, from four other places:
#
#   internal/cli/... `leoflow lite` flag help and the resolved-backend note
#   website/content/get-started/quickstart.md
#   website/content/concepts/editions.md
#   website/content/contribute/local-dev-loop.md
#
# The compose file is the only one of the five that does anything; the rest are
# a version string with nothing between them and the thing they describe. This
# is the same shape as check-lite-prepull-matches-compose.sh, which reconciles
# the SIXTH copy — the pre-pull tag baked into the cold-start release gate. That
# gate exists because a stale copy there wastes the boot budget. This one exists
# because a stale copy here tells the user, on their terminal, a fact about
# their own machine that is not true. They have a container running, we name a
# different one, and the mismatch shows up when they go looking for the volume
# or the port and find the wrong thing.
#
# Scope is deliberately narrow. Three other Postgres tags in this tree are NOT
# this fact and must not be dragged into it: docker-compose.yml runs 17-alpine
# for the Pro stack, the e2e scripts run their own warehouse container for dbt,
# and helm/leoflow ships an evaluation datastore. Nothing says those should
# track Lite's, and a gate that forced them to would be inventing a policy
# rather than catching drift.
#
# website/content/project/ is excluded for the same reason
# check-python-runtime-matrix.sh excludes CHANGELOG.md: an ADR records the
# decision of its era and is immutable (CLAUDE.md), so "correcting" one would be
# falsifying history.
#
# Usage: scripts/check-lite-postgres-tag.sh [--self-test]
#        scripts/check-lite-postgres-tag.sh <repo-root>
