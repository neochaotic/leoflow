# The Lite cold-start release gate pre-pulls the Postgres image by tag, and the
# tag must equal the one Lite actually starts.
#
# That job has no checkout — it installs from the published release, which is
# the point of it — so it cannot read docker-compose.dev.yaml at runtime and the
# tag is written into the workflow. Two copies of a version string with nothing
# between them is how the docs/adr links and the dependabot directories rotted,
# so this is the gate for it. The tree already carries two Postgres majors
# (docker-compose.yml runs 17-alpine, docker-compose.dev.yaml runs 16), so
# "someone bumps the wrong file" is not hypothetical here.
#
# If they drift, the pre-pull silently fetches an image nobody starts, the real
# one is downloaded inside the /readyz budget again, and a slow registry eats
# the boot margin (#977).
#
# Both sides are parsed as YAML rather than grepped. An earlier awk version had
# a fail-open a reviewer reproduced in one line: commenting out the pull step —
# the most common way a step gets disabled while debugging — left the gate
# green, because a `#`-prefixed line still matched. Scoping to the job's parsed
# steps and dropping comment lines is what closes that, and it is also what
# allows the pull to be a multi-line retry block.
