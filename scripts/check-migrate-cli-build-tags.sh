# Keep the migrate CLI we SHIP and the migrate CLI we SCAN the same binary.
#
# `deploy/Dockerfile.migrate` compiles golang-migrate's own `cmd/migrate` from
# the version in our go.mod (#1039), and `.github/workflows/security.yaml` runs
# `govulncheck` over that same package so the binary is inside the module graph
# CI actually reads. Both ends of that chain are needed, and neither proves the
# other:
#
#   - golang-migrate registers database drivers behind BUILD TAGS. A binary
#     built with `-tags 'postgres pgx5'` and analysed with no tags is analysed
#     without the drivers it ships — govulncheck reports clean on a package that
#     is not the one in the image, and reports it in a green check. The reverse
#     drift (a tag added to the scan and not to the build) is quieter still.
#   - Trivy keys `stdlib` findings to the Go toolchain recorded in the binary's
#     build info. If the Dockerfile's GO_VERSION and the workflow's diverge, the
#     blocking image gate scans a toolchain the release never builds with.
#
# The failure mode both share is silence: everything stays green while the
# coverage stops meaning anything. That is the exact shape of the gap #1039
# closed — a migrate binary nobody was watching — so it gets a gate rather than
# a comment asking the next reader to keep two files in sync.
