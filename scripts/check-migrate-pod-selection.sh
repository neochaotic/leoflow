# The migration hook pod must not be selectable by any control-plane Service or
# PodDisruptionBudget, in any deployment mode (#1055).
#
# Selection in Kubernetes is a SUBSET relation: a Service sends traffic to every
# pod whose labels contain all of the selector's key/value pairs. Extra labels on
# the pod do not exclude it. `leoflow.roleSelectorLabels` for the default "all"
# role is exactly `leoflow.selectorLabels` (ADR 0049 keeps it that way so the
# Deployment's immutable selector survives an upgrade from a pre-split install),
# so the migrate Job's pod template carrying that same set made the pod an
# endpoint of the control-plane Service. A Job pod has no readinessProbe, so it
# is Ready the instant its container starts: on `helm upgrade`, where the Service
# already exists while the pre-upgrade hook runs, the hook pod was an endpoint of
# the control plane and a healthy member of its PodDisruptionBudget. `helm install`
# was unaffected — no Service exists yet.
#
# The disruption half was the measured loss (a percentage-valued budget fails
# outright with "jobs.batch does not implement the scale subresource"). The
# traffic half is latent rather than active, and only by accident: every Service
# port here uses a NAMED targetPort and the hook pod declares no containerPort, so
# the endpoint lands in a slice with `ports: null` and kube-proxy programs nothing.
# One numeric targetPort removes that, and consumers that resolve ports themselves
# never had it. Both are reasons to fix the selection, not to rely on the accident.
#
# Why this is a script and not a helm-unittest case: the invariant lives BETWEEN
# two rendered documents, and helm-unittest asserts one document at a time. Both
# maps were individually "correct" for ~246 cases while their relationship was
# wrong. This renders the chart and compares the real maps, so a future edit to
# EITHER side — the Job's pod labels or any control-plane selector — is caught by
# the same gate. helm/leoflow/tests/migrate_pod_selection_test.yaml pins the
# shapes; this asserts the property.
