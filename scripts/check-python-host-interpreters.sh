# The CLI states two more Python facts that the published-image matrix does not
# cover, and they are NOT the same fact as it (#1031, #1036).
#
# check-python-runtime-matrix.sh reconciles the copies of one list: the Python
# lines Leoflow publishes a task base image for. These two answer a different
# question — which interpreter runs on the DEVELOPER's host, in Lite:
#
#   internal/setup/python.go   the managed CPython we download when the host has none
#   internal/setup/detect.go   the interpreter binary names we probe for on PATH
#
# So the assertions here are RELATIONSHIPS, not equality:
#
#   1. The managed CPython's minor is a MEMBER of the published matrix. If it is
#      not, a Lite user who let us install their interpreter develops on a minor
#      we publish no base image for, and finds out at `leoflow compile` when the
#      pull 404s — inside their build, naming an image they never typed.
#   2. Every probe candidate is either in the matrix, or carries an explicit
#      `// lite-only` marker on its line — an author assertion nothing else
#      verifies, so this gate checks it BOTH ways and fails a marker on a line
#      that IS published, rather than letting it become a mute button.
#      The probe list is deliberately WIDER:
#      it reaches forward to minors that have not shipped yet, because the Lite
#      parser shim is stdlib-only (ADR 0024) and any of them can parse a dag.py
#      on this host. A candidate that is neither published nor marked is the
#      thing #1031 actually got wrong: a version in one list, absent from the
#      other, and nothing saying whether that was a decision or a mistake.
#   3. The first (highest-priority) probe candidate is the managed CPython's
#      minor. detect.go's own comment states this — "3.11 wins when present
#      because it's the version the managed CPython matches, keeping dev/prod
#      parity" — and it is the arm most likely to rot, because bumping the
#      managed interpreter is a one-line change in a different file.
#
# The marker is per-line rather than positional on purpose. A gate that assumed
# "the published ones come first" would silently exempt everything the day
# somebody reordered the slice for readability.
#
