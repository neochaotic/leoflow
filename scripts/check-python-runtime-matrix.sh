#!/usr/bin/env bash
# The set of Python lines Leoflow publishes a task base image for is stated in
# five files, and only one of them is enforced by anything.
#
# The enforced one is the `python_version` enum in
# internal/domain/schemas/leoflow-yaml-schema.json: it is embedded into the CLI
# and `LeoflowConfig.Validate()` rejects anything else. (docs/api/ carries the
# byte-equal canonical mirror of the same file; TestEmbeddedSchemasMatchDocs
# already binds the two, so this gate reads the copy that actually ships in the
# binary.) The other four are the
# release matrix that actually pushes the images, the Makefile target that
# builds them locally, the comment in runtime/Dockerfile, and the configuration
# reference the user reads. Nothing reconciled them, and by #1031 they had
# already drifted in both directions: the release published py3.10 while the
# host detector probed for a 3.13 nobody published.
#
# Both directions of drift fail in the same expensive place. A version in the
# enum with no published leg is a `docker pull ... 404` inside the USER's build,
# minutes after their compile started, naming an image they never typed. A
# published leg missing from the enum is a `leoflow compile` that refuses a
# perfectly good image with "value must be one of" — and the user cannot fix
# either one, because both live in our repo.
#
# This is the same "two copies of a fact with nothing between them" shape as
# check-lite-prepull-matches-compose.sh, and it takes the same two lessons from
# it. The workflow is parsed as YAML, not grepped, so a commented-out matrix
# cannot keep the gate green. And a missing file, a renamed job or an
# unrecognized declaration is a FAIL, never a silent pass — a gate that stops
# gating after a file move is worse than no gate, because it still reports OK.
#
# The floor in runtime/python/pyproject.toml is checked too: the runtime helper
# is pip-installed INTO the base image, so a `requires-python` above the oldest
# published line makes that leg unbuildable, and one below it advertises support
# for an interpreter we ship no image for.
#
# The gate reconciles the deprecation STATUS AND DATES as well as the list, and
# that second half is not optional. Reconciling only the set of versions leaves
# the half a user acts on unguarded: move a deprecation from 3.10 to 3.11 in the
# schema and every version still appears in every file, so the list arms stay
# green while the support table in the configuration reference — the only place
# a user learns the date — says the exact opposite of what the CLI enforces and
# what the weekly watchdog asserts. The same date is hardcoded in release.yaml's
# comment above the matrix, which is the copy a maintainer reads while editing
# the matrix that publishes the leg, so it is reconciled too. A wrong date is
# worse than a missing one: it answers the question the reader came with.
#
# The same argument runs one step further, and that is the last arm. The
# deprecation `reason` is printed VERBATIM to the user on compile, validate and
# deploy, and it named a full base-image tag including the Debian suite. Move
# the task base from one Debian release to the next and every arm above stays
# green — the versions and the dates did not change — while that sentence now
# describes an image nobody builds. A reader checks the Dockerfile the compiler
# generated, sees a different suite, and dismisses the warning as stale tooling,
# which retires the one mechanism there is for reaching them before the leg
# stops being published. So the suite named in the schema and in the
# configuration reference is reconciled against runtime/Dockerfile's stage-2
# FROM — and the fix that failure recommends is to stop naming a suite at all,
# because `python:3.10-slim` is correct on every one of them.
