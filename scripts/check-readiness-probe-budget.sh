# The readiness timeout is one relationship written in three places, and none of
# them can see the other two.
#
#   internal/api/health.go        probeBudget          — how long /readyz will spend
#   helm/.../_helpers.tpl         $min                 — the floor the chart refuses to go under
#   helm/leoflow/values.yaml      probes.readiness.timeoutSeconds — what the kubelet actually gets
#
# The invariant is  probeBudget < floor <= default:  the server has to give up
# before the kubelet does, or the kubelet cancels a probe that was about to
# answer and the operator gets a bare timeout instead of a 503 naming the
# dependency (#1023, #1040, #1041). The floor is what makes that true for every
# operator, and the default has to satisfy its own floor.
#
# Nothing reconciles a Go constant with a Helm template. Lowering probeBudget to
# 4s to "give a slow database more room" would leave the floor at 3 and silently
# invert the relationship for everyone on the default, with the whole test suite
# green — the same shape as the drift this repo already gates for the Lite
# pre-pull tag and the Task SDK pin.
