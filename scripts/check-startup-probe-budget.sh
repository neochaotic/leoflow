# The startup gate's budget is a claim about the server's boot, and the two
# halves of that claim live in different languages:
#
#   internal/storage/postgres.go   pgStartupBudget        how long the connect retry may spend
#   cmd/leoflow-server/main.go     podInformerSyncTimeout how long the informer warm-up may spend
#   cmd/leoflow-server/main.go     oidcDiscoveryTimeout   how long IdP discovery may spend
#   helm/leoflow/values.yaml       probes.startup.*       what the kubelet actually allows
#
# The invariant is
#   startup budget >= (2 * pgStartupBudget) + podInformerSyncTimeout + oidcDiscoveryTimeout + headroom.
# Twice the Postgres budget because NewPostgres runs the retry loop once for the
# request pool and once for the dedicated probe pool, so a slow-to-accept
# Postgres can spend both. OIDC discovery counts unconditionally even though it
# only runs under auth.provider: oidc, because the floor has to cover the worst
# boot the chart can be configured into, not the common one. The headroom covers
# what is left with no bound of its own: credential detection for an object-store
# log sink, and process start.
#
# It matters because a startup budget under the boot it is gating kills a pod
# that was about to come up, which is the restart loop the gate exists to end
# (#1083). Nothing reconciles a Go constant with a Helm value: raising
# pgStartupBudget to 60s "so a failover blip cannot fail boot" would put the
# code-defined floor at 145s under a 180s gate, leaving 35s of slack where the
# gate requires 60s, and the whole test suite green. The same drift shape this
# repo already gates for the readiness timeout, the Lite pre-pull tag and the
# Task SDK pin.
#
# The gate also re-asserts, on the shipped defaults, the relation the chart
# enforces per-render: the startup budget must EXCEED the liveness budget it
# replaces, or it only moves the kill from one probe to the other.
#
# Usage: scripts/check-startup-probe-budget.sh [--self-test]

# Seconds of slack the gate must leave above the bounds the code states for
