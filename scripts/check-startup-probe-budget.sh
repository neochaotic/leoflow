# The startup gate's budget is a claim about the server's boot, and the two
# halves of that claim live in different languages:
#
#   internal/storage/postgres.go   pgStartupBudget        how long the connect retry may spend
#   cmd/leoflow-server/main.go     podInformerSyncTimeout how long the informer warm-up may spend
#   helm/leoflow/values.yaml       probes.startup.*       what the kubelet actually allows
#
# The invariant is  startup budget >= (2 * pgStartupBudget) + podInformerSyncTimeout + headroom.
# Twice the Postgres budget because NewPostgres runs the retry loop once for the
# request pool and once for the dedicated probe pool, so a slow-to-accept
# Postgres can spend both. The headroom covers the boot work that carries no
# bound of its own: credential detection for an object-store log sink, OIDC
# discovery, and process start.
#
# It matters because a startup budget under the boot it is gating kills a pod
# that was about to come up, which is the restart loop the gate exists to end
# (#1083). Nothing reconciles a Go constant with a Helm value: raising
# pgStartupBudget to 60s "so a failover blip cannot fail boot" would put the
# code-defined floor at 130s under a 180s gate with 50s of headroom gone and the
# whole test suite green. The same drift shape this repo already gates for the
# readiness timeout, the Lite pre-pull tag and the Task SDK pin.
#
# The gate also re-asserts, on the shipped defaults, the relation the chart
# enforces per-render: the startup budget must EXCEED the liveness budget it
# replaces, or it only moves the kill from one probe to the other.
#
# Usage: scripts/check-startup-probe-budget.sh [--self-test]
