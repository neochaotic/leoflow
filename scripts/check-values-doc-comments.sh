# check-values-doc-comments.sh — a chart values.yaml doc comment must not carry a
# second " --" on its delimiter line.
#
# helm-docs treats a space followed by two dashes as the doc-comment delimiter,
# and it takes the LAST one on the line. So a description that mentions a CLI
# flag in prose — `helm --set-string`, the shape that actually shipped — has its
# text and its `(bool)` type hint swallowed: the README row renders with an empty
# description and the type inferred from a nil value, i.e. `string` for what the
# chart documents and validates as a tri-state boolean.
#
# The helm-docs CI gate cannot catch this. It diffs the committed README against
# helm-docs' own output, and helm-docs produces the broken row deterministically,
# so the gate is SATISFIED by it. Nothing else compares the row against the
# comment that was meant to produce it — hence this script.
#
# Scope is the delimiter line only, and that is deliberate rather than lazy:
# continuation lines of a multi-line doc comment carry " --" through to the
# README intact (verified against helm-docs 1.14.2), as do plain `#` block
# comments, which helm-docs does not read at all. Flagging those would be noise.
#
# The fix is never to drop the flag from the prose: hug the dashes with a
# backtick so no space immediately precedes them (helm `--set-string`), which
# reads better in the rendered table anyway.
