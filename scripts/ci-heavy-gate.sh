# Decide whether a pull request needs the heavy k3d end-to-end jobs.
#
# Four jobs ask this question: operator-e2e, split-e2e, e2e-dbt and deploy-e2e.
# The answer used to be a regex pasted into each of them, four copies of one
# decision with nothing reconciling them and no way to ask "would this file list
# run or skip?" short of opening a pull request and watching.
#
# That cost a real cycle. When changelog fragments landed (#1200), every pull
# request started carrying a `.changes/unreleased/*.yaml` file, and `.changes/`
# was not in the allowlist, so the docs-only pull requests this gate exists to
# spare became the ones it stopped sparing. It was found by reading, not by a
# test, because there was no test to fail.
#
# The gate deliberately lives INSIDE each job rather than as a `paths:` filter
# or a job-level `if:`. A skipped job reports nothing, so a failure already
# recorded on that commit stays red forever: rerunning a `pull_request` run
# replays the original event payload, so the condition evaluates the same way
# every time and no remedy can clear the check. changelog-guard.yaml carries
# that lesson, learned from the v0.4.7 cut (#1176).
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/ci-heavy-gate.sh <event-name> <base-ref>   # writes run=… to $GITHUB_OUTPUT
#   scripts/ci-heavy-gate.sh --decide                  # reads a file list on stdin, prints run|skip
#   scripts/ci-heavy-gate.sh --self-test
