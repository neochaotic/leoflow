# Cut a Leoflow release — one repo-owned entrypoint for the whole flow so the
# steps are not re-invented (and re-broken) by hand each time (#879).
#
# It: preflights, prepares the chart/CHANGELOG bump on a release branch, opens the
# prepare PR, waits for CI green (re-running ONLY known-transient flakes, never
# hard-failing on them), squash-merges, waits for main green on the merge commit,
# then — behind an explicit confirmation gate — tags and pushes, and watches the
# release workflows to PUBLISHED. A structured log is written for provenance.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/cut-release.sh v0.4.4-rc.1            # interactive confirm before tag
#   scripts/cut-release.sh 0.4.4 --yes            # non-interactive (CI/automation)
#   scripts/cut-release.sh v0.4.4-rc.1 --dry-run  # preflight + print the plan, no mutation
#   scripts/cut-release.sh <version> --resume     # finish a cut that died after
#                                                 # the prepare PR merged
#   scripts/cut-release.sh --self-test            # pure-logic cases, no network
#
# A `-rc.N` version keeps CHANGELOG `[Unreleased]`; a GA version (no `-rc`) moves
# `[Unreleased]` to `[X.Y.Z] - <date>` and opens a fresh `[Unreleased]`.
#
# Release-auth: the tag+push (the irreversible publish) NEVER happens without an
# explicit confirmation — the interactive prompt, or `--yes` passed deliberately.

# Transient CI failures that are safe to rerun — never a code signal. Matches the
# classes seen in practice: registry rate-limits and 5xx, Go module-proxy stream
# resets, the shallow-fetch merge-base gate, the lite cold-start /readyz timing
# flake, a package index answering 5xx mid-resolve, and a k3d cluster that fails
# to come up. Every alternative is covered by the table in self_test(); add a
# pattern there first, with the line that motivated it, or it is not coverage.
#
# Deliberately absent: anything that also matches a failure of OUR OWN code. A
# "returned error: 5xx" alternative looks like a registry pattern but is what
# curl prints for a 5xx out of our control plane, which this harness queries
# from 60 sites — it would rerun past the commonest real regression there is.

#   NONE                    no runs for this sha yet — keep waiting
#   PENDING                 at least one run has not completed
#   GREEN                   every run completed in {success, skipped, neutral}
#   FAILED                  at least one `failure`, and nothing worse
#   BLOCKED <conclusions>   a completed run whose conclusion is neither a pass
#                           nor a plain failure
#
# BLOCKED is the whole point. A cancelled run has status "completed" and a
# conclusion that is not "failure", so it is neither pending nor failed — and
# the old form here returned GREEN for it. On the merge commit that is the last
# gate before `git tag`, so the cut would tag a sha whose CI never finished and
# the "main red — NOT tagging" guard would never fire. timed_out,
# startup_failure, stale and action_required have the same shape.
#
# BLOCKED outranks FAILED, and the reason is the rerun loop rather than
# FLAKE_RE: the old `failed=` list only ever collected conclusion=="failure",
# so a cancelled run was never a rerun candidate to begin with. What it did
# instead was survive. One transient failure plus one cancelled run meant
# FLAKE_RE matched the failure, the rerun ground it to success, and the next
# iteration found an empty `failed` list with the cancelled run still sitting
# there — so the loop laundered the sha and echoed GREEN. Ranking BLOCKED above
# FAILED is what stops that. It also would not converge if we tried: `gh run
# rerun --failed` has nothing to act on when a run's jobs concluded cancelled.
