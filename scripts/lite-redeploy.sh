#!/usr/bin/env bash
# lite-redeploy.sh — local Mac/Linux dev loop for `leoflow lite`.
#
# Rebuilds leoflow / leoflow-server / leoflow-agent from the current source,
# stops the running lite (if any), swaps the binaries in BOTH places lite
# resolves them from (./bin and ~/.leoflow/bin — see resolveBinary in
# internal/cli/dev.go), and restarts `leoflow lite --postgres managed`. Polls
# /readyz and prints the URL + a tail of the boot log.
#
# Why both dirs? `leoflow lite` shells out to `leoflow-server` and resolves it
# via: explicit flag → PATH → ./bin/leoflow-server. Same for leoflow-agent
# (subprocess executor's agent_path). If only one is updated, the OTHER stale
# binary silently runs and the loop debugging gets confusing.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/lite-redeploy.sh           # rebuild, restart, tail
#   PORT=9090 scripts/lite-redeploy.sh # custom port
#
# Stop with: kill $(cat /tmp/leoflow-lite.pid)
