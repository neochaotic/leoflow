# Weekly watch on the Python lines we publish a base image for.
#
# #1031 was found by hand, seven weeks before python:3.10-slim stops being
# rebuilt. Nothing in the repo would have found it at all: an EOL is a date, and
# a date passes without any commit, any CI run and any diff. Every other supply
# chain signal we have (Dependabot, Trivy, govulncheck) reacts to a CVE that
# already exists, which for a frozen base image is precisely the signal that
# stops arriving — docker-library/python stops rebuilding an EOL line the day
# after it goes EOL (python:3.9-slim was last rebuilt 2025-11-01, one day after
# 3.9's EOL), so the image simply stops changing while the CVEs accumulate under
# it.
#
# So this asks the calendar instead, weekly, from the scheduled security
# workflow, and it does not gate anything. It is deliberately NOT named
# check-*.sh: cut-release.sh's run_gates() globs that prefix, and a release must
# never be blocked because a date is approaching or because a third-party JSON
# endpoint is down. The one thing it does exit non-zero for is its OWN failure
# (no network, unparseable feed) — a watchdog that cannot tell you it is broken
# is worse than no watchdog, and it is on a path where red costs nothing.
#
# Two findings are worth a human:
#   1. a line we still call supported is within EOL_WARN_DAYS of upstream EOL —
#      the one that would have raised #1031 in January instead of September;
#   2. a line the schema already marked deprecated is still in the enum after
#      its own remove_after date — the deprecation that quietly never happened.
# An already-deprecated line inside its window is a notice, not an alert: we
# know, the date is recorded, and repeating it weekly is how a real alert gets
# filtered out.
#
# Usage: scripts/python-eol-warn.sh [--self-test]
#        scripts/python-eol-warn.sh [<eol-json>] [<today YYYY-MM-DD>]
#
# Env: EOL_WARN_DAYS (default 270) — how far out a supported line raises.
