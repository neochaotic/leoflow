# rbac-covers-executor.sh — the chart's Role must permit every Kubernetes call
# the executor makes.
#
# These two files have no compiler between them. The executor gained PVC
# create/delete for the staging volume (ADR 0022) and the Role was never
# updated, so every DAG using staging failed with a 403 in any cluster that
# enforces RBAC — while `helm unittest` stayed green, because it asserts what
# the template renders and never what the code needs.
#
# This closes the loop in the direction that bites: a call with no permission is
# an error. The reverse (a permission with no call) is reported as a warning
# only — over-granting is worth knowing about, but it is not a broken deploy,
# and `get`/`watch` on pods are plausibly wanted by future work.
#
# It is a grep, not type-aware analysis. It reads `CoreV1().<Resource>(...)` and
# the verb chained onto it, which is how every call in internal/executor is
# written today. A call built through a variable would be missed — accepted,
# because the alternative is a linter plugin and this catches the real drift.
