# Compose the GitHub Release body for a tag, from CHANGELOG.md.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. The release body used to be GoReleaser's commit list, and on
# a GA that list is empty by construction: a GA is cut from the rc, so the only
# commit between the two tags is the promotion itself. v0.4.7's release page
# says exactly one line, `release: promote v0.4.7 GA`, while CHANGELOG.md holds
# 35 entries for the same version. The page most people land on carried none of
# the release, and the prose written for humans stayed in a file.
#
# It also silently kept noise it meant to drop: the exclude filters were
# `^docs:`, `^test:`, `^chore:`, and every commit in this repository is scoped
# (`docs(changelog):`), so the anchored patterns never matched one of them.
# Removing the generated list removes that whole class rather than patching the
# regexes.
#
# The commits are not lost: the footer links the compare view, which is the
# complete log, one click away, instead of a filtered copy of it.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/release-notes.sh v0.4.8           # GA: the [0.4.8] section
#   scripts/release-notes.sh v0.4.8-rc.1      # rc: the [Unreleased] section
#   scripts/release-notes.sh --self-test

## Leoflow ${tag}

A \`0.x\` (pre-1.0) build — SemVer carries the maturity, there is no separate
alpha/beta, and the pre-alpha series ended at \`v0.0.1\` (ADR 0037). APIs and
on-disk shape may still evolve between minor versions; \`-rc.N\` tags are release
candidates gated by the E2E suite. Install **this exact release** with:

\`\`\`bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neochaotic/leoflow/${tag}/install.sh | LEOFLOW_VERSION=${tag} sh
\`\`\`

> A bare \`curl … | sh\` installs the latest **stable** release (\`/releases/latest\`
> excludes pre-releases), so on a pre-release page it would NOT give you \`${tag}\`.
> \`LEOFLOW_VERSION\` must sit on the **\`sh\`** side of the pipe (not \`curl\`) — a
> \`VAR=x curl … | sh\` prefix sets the var for \`curl\` only, so \`install.sh\` would
> not see it and would fall back to latest-stable.
