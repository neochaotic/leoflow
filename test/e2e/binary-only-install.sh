# Genuine binary-only install of Leoflow (#587): a built binary run from OUTSIDE
# the repo, with a clean HOME and NO PYTHONPATH — the real "download the release
# and run it" UX. Every other e2e job presets `PYTHONPATH: parser` (repo path),
# which masks the exact parser-resolution path this exercises.
#
# Asserts:
#   1. `leoflow compile` resolves the embedded parser with no PYTHONPATH and no
#      repo on any path (the primary symptom: `No module named leoflow_parser`).
#   2. the binary self-extracts BOTH the parser AND the runtime sources the Lite
#      per-DAG venv is built from — the venv-before-extract ordering precondition
#      (the second symptom: `'<home>/.leoflow/pysrc/runtime/python' does not exist`).
#
# No Postgres/Redis/agent needed: the failure was in resolution + extraction, not
# in any runtime state, so this gate stays fast and deterministic.
