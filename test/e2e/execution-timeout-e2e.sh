# End-to-end test for `execution_timeout` on a real Kubernetes cluster (k3d),
# #925 + #930. This is the seam no unit test can reach: it needs a real kubelet,
# because the kubelet counts activeDeadlineSeconds from pod.Status.StartTime —
# a field only a kubelet stamps.
#
# Why a real cluster is the only proof. Two clocks bound a task that declares
# execution_timeout_seconds: the AGENT's (started inside its execute step) and
# the KUBELET's (activeDeadlineSeconds from StartTime, stamped before the image
# pull). The agent owns the SEMANTIC timeout — it is the only one that can say
# "execution_timeout: task exceeded Xs limit". The kubelet's is a backstop for
# an agent that can no longer enforce anything, so it must never fire first;
# when it does, the pod is gone and the reason degrades to what Kubernetes saw
# from outside, which cannot name a timeout. A unit test can pin each half, but
# only a kubelet can run the race.
#
# "Visible" throughout means SERVED on the task-instance API (`failure_reason`),
# which is where this script reads it. The UI does not render the field, so no
# assertion here says anything about what an operator sees on a screen.
#
# The scenario declares `execution_timeout_seconds: 10` on a task that sleeps
# far past it, with the image PRE-LOADED into the cluster so the startup delta
# is a few seconds and the run stays fast.
#
# What is red before #925, precisely. Assertion 3 is red UNCONDITIONALLY: the
# pod deadline was the declared timeout itself, so 10 rather than 220, on any
# host. Assertion 1 — the API-visible consequence assertion 3 exists to
# produce — is red wherever the startup the agent's clock does not cover
# exceeds the kubelet's deadline-check granularity, which is every real
# cluster (the image pull and volume mount dominate there, and the kubelet then
# killed at 10s from StartTime while the agent would only fire at 13-15s, so
# the task instance's served reason was the generic container-terminated one).
# On a warm local k3d with the image already imported that startup is
# sub-second, so assertion 1 alone is a coin flip HERE — which is exactly why
# assertion 3 asserts the arithmetic directly rather than inferring it from the
# outcome.
#
# Four assertions:
#   1. the timed-out task instance's `failure_reason` names `execution_timeout:`
#      — the agent won the race — AND the sleeper pod's own `status.reason` is
#      NOT `DeadlineExceeded`, which names the race winner directly rather than
#      inferring it from the message. The pod-level check is strictly tighter:
#      it also catches the agent's report landing and the kubelet then killing
#      the pod anyway;
#   2. the pod's DURABLE OUTCOME RECORD carries the same diagnosis (#930). This
#      asserts the BYTES are on the pod, not that the reconciler rendered them:
#      the report does land in this scenario, so the record is the channel a
#      LOST report would be settled from, and the settling itself is covered by
#      internal/executor's unit tests;
#   3. a pod created through the REAL DISPATCH PATH carries
#      activeDeadlineSeconds == declared timeout + startup headroom + effective
#      termination grace — locking the seam through dispatch, not just the pod
#      builder, which a unit test already covers;
#   4. an agent frozen after RUNNING has its attempt settled by the AGENT-LOST
#      REAPER inside a window bounded by the ladder itself (75-135s after the
#      freeze; see REAP_MIN/REAP_MAX), instead of lingering to the pod deadline
#      (which for a task declaring no timeout is the 24h credential ceiling).

# of a live task — so it is set just under 75 for clock slack, not far under.
