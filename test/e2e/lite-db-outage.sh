# End-to-end for #1087: what the control plane tells a caller when its database
# is unreachable MID-FLIGHT, with a token that was valid seconds earlier.
#
# This is the seam unit tests cannot reach. They assert the mapping given an
# injected error; only a real outage proves the error a real driver produces on
# a real pool takes that mapping — and the defect this locks was precisely a
# mapping that looked right in isolation. It was found by hand during the
# v0.4.6 cluster validation and had no executable form until now.
#
# What is asserted, and why each one is the thing that misled someone:
#
#   1. A protected route answers 503, NOT 401. A 401 tells a well-behaved client
#      to re-authenticate against the database that is already down, and tells
#      whoever is on call that they have an auth incident.
#   2. /api/v2/auth/token/renew answers 503, NOT 401 — the same conflation lived
#      one function below the first, and its handler recorded no cause at all,
#      so the outage was invisible in the log.
#   3. The response bodies carry no driver text, and the LOG carries the cause.
#      Sanitizing without keeping the cause is not privacy, it is losing the
#      diagnosis (#961).
#   4. Recovery: the same token works again once Postgres is back, so the 503 is
#      about availability and never revoked anything.
#
# NOT covered here, deliberately: #1071's 499-vs-500 split in handleRepoError.
# With the database down, auth fails first and the request never reaches the
# repository, so that path is unreachable from this shape. Exercising it needs a
# fault-injection proxy that can fail queries while auth still succeeds.
#
# Requires Postgres + Redis as CONTAINERS (this stops and restarts the Postgres
# one) and docker on PATH. DESTRUCTIVE: resets the leoflow_dev database.
