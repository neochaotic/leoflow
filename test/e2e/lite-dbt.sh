# End-to-end gate for dbt on the LITE edition (subprocess executor) against duckdb
# — the credential-free focus adapter that had no e2e (#573). Pro dbt is covered
# by dbt-e2e.sh (k3d + Postgres); this is the Lite half: a duckdb dbt project must
# compile with the zero-config duckdb profile step (#575), run through the
# subprocess executor, and actually materialize its models in the duckdb file.
#
# What the unit tests can't prove is the wiring composed end to end: leoflow
# compiles the project with the `--dbt-default-duckdb` prefix + absolute
# --project-dir (#575), Lite provisions the per-DAG venv from `dependencies:`
# (so `dbt` resolves on PATH), and the task's `python -m leoflow_runtime
# --dbt-default-duckdb … && dbt …` command writes profiles.yml and materializes.
#
# The manifest is pre-parsed here (like dbt-e2e.sh) so Lite reads a baked
# target/manifest.json rather than depending on parse-on-save ordering.
#
# Needs a local Postgres (docker-compose.dev.yaml) and dbt-duckdb available to
# pre-parse. Run from the repo root:  bash test/e2e/lite-dbt.sh
