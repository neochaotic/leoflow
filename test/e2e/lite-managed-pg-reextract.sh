# End-to-end gate for the managed-Postgres re-extract idempotency fix (#729).
#
# `leoflow lite --postgres managed` downloads a relocatable PostgreSQL under
# ~/.leoflow/postgres and extracts it. A re-run over an EXISTING install used to
# break two ways:
#   1. extractSymlink ended with os.Symlink, which fails EEXIST when the link
#      target already exists (the regular-file branch overwrites via O_TRUNC), so
#      only symlinked entries broke a re-extract over a non-empty postgres dir
#      (a partial/interrupted prior extract, or a cross-version layout change).
#   2. the presence guard keyed on the mere presence of bin/postgres, not its
#      version — so a clean upgrade silently kept the prior release's Postgres and
#      never re-extracted.
#
# This test boots managed Postgres, then simulates a cross-version on-disk state
# (older version sentinel) plus a pre-existing symlink, and asserts a second boot
# re-extracts idempotently (no EEXIST) and records the bundled version.
#
# Opt-in: it downloads a ~11 MB PostgreSQL from GitHub and needs a host where the
# relocatable build can run (glibc + ICU/Kerberos). Skipped unless enabled:
#   LEOFLOW_E2E_MANAGED_PG=1 bash test/e2e/lite-managed-pg-reextract.sh
