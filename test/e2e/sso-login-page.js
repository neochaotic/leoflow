// Browser assertions for the sign-in page. Three of them need a browser and
// cannot be had from a Go handler test.
//
// #1160: a deployment configured for SSO must OFFER the flow, and a refused
// sign-on must come BACK to the sign-in page saying so, rather than to a page of
// raw JSON. A Go handler test pins the rendered bytes, which is necessary and
// not sufficient: the defect was that a real user, on a correctly configured SSO
// deployment, saw a username and password form and no way in. They typed their
// IdP credentials into it, got "Invalid credentials", and produced no audit
// record at all, because no OIDC request was ever made.
//
// #1191: a break-glass password login on top of a live SSO session must REPLACE
// the identity. This is the one that is browser rules all the way down. A script
// cannot overwrite an HttpOnly cookie, so while the sign-in page set the session
// cookie with document.cookie, the token a password login had just been issued
// never reached the jar: the browser kept sending the SSO cookie, the UI kept
// showing the SSO identity, and the server logged a 200. Nothing below the
// browser can observe that, so it is asserted here, through a real SSO login
// against a real IdP handshake and a real form submit with no sign-out in
// between.
//
// #1191, second half: the session cookie must be HttpOnly on BOTH paths. The
// JWT-only arm proves it where it was never true at all, by asserting that a
// signed-in page cannot see the session token in document.cookie.
//
// Same reasoning as ui-smoke.js, which exists because the React layer once
// shipped broken and only a browser caught it.
//
// Usage (see sso-login-page.sh, which stands up the fake IdP and the servers):
//   LEOFLOW_URL=http://localhost:18080 node test/e2e/sso-login-page.js
//   LEOFLOW_URL=http://localhost:18081 LEOFLOW_EXPECT_SSO=0 node test/e2e/sso-login-page.js
