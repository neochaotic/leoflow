# Stands up what the browser assertions in sso-login-page.js need and runs it
# twice: once against a control plane with SSO configured, once without.
#
# It covers two things a Go handler test cannot reach. #1160: a deployment
# configured for SSO must OFFER the flow, and a refused sign-on must come back to
# the sign-in page saying so. #1191: a break-glass password login on top of a
# live SSO session must REPLACE the identity. That second one is browser
# behavior and nothing else can prove it. A script cannot overwrite an HttpOnly
# cookie, so while the login page set the session cookie with document.cookie the
# browser silently kept the SSO identity while the server answered 200. Proving
# it needs a real SSO login to have happened first, so the fake IdP below signs
# real ID tokens rather than only serving discovery.
#
# The awkward part is that leoflow refuses a non-https issuer at boot, and OIDC
# discovery happens at boot, so a fake IdP has to serve
# /.well-known/openid-configuration over TLS before the server will start at all.
# This generates a throwaway CA for it and points the server at that CA through
# SSL_CERT_FILE, which the Linux build of Go's crypto/x509 reads. Nothing here
# touches the system trust store.
#
# Requirements: openssl, python3, node with playwright-core, the golang-migrate
# CLI (`migrate`), a built bin/leoflow-server, and a reachable dev Postgres.
#
# Usage: test/e2e/sso-login-page.sh
set -euo pipefail

# PLATFORM NOTE. This needs Go to trust a throwaway CA through SSL_CERT_FILE,
# because leoflow refuses a non-https issuer and discovery happens at boot. That
# works on Linux, which is where CI runs it. It does NOT work on macOS: the darwin
# build of crypto/x509 defers to the platform verifier and has no SSL_CERT_FILE
# path at all, so the variable is read by nothing.
#
# Measure that with a handshake, not with the cert pool. x509.SystemCertPool on
# darwin returns a pool whose Subjects() is empty whether or not SSL_CERT_FILE is
# set, so "empty pool" is the same observation in both cases and distinguishes
# nothing. An https GET against a server holding a cert signed by the named CA
# does distinguish, and on macOS it fails with "certificate signed by unknown
# authority" with the variable set (measured, go1.26, darwin/arm64).
#
# On a Mac, run it inside a Linux container or let CI run it.
