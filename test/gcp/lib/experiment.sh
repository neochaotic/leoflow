# The harness the three runners share: a run directory, a cluster, and the one
# invariant that matters more than any result they produce.
#
# THE INVARIANT: a runner that exits without tearing down is a defect, and it is
# a defect on EVERY exit path, not just the happy one. A cluster survives a
# crash, a Ctrl-C, a failed assertion, a `set -e` trip in a helper, and an
# unbound variable, so the teardown is installed as a trap on all of them BEFORE
# the cluster exists, and the trap is the only thing that deletes. No runner
# calls teardown.sh itself: a script with two teardown paths has one that is
# never tested.
#
# The node TTL that provision.sh puts on the pool is the backstop under all of
# this. The trap is what keeps a six-hour bill from a six-minute experiment; the
# TTL is what keeps a forever bill from a laptop that slept. They are not
# alternatives and this file relies on both.
#
# Sourced by the runners, never executed, except for --self-test.

  $1

  This runner has never been run against a real cluster. Reason on record:

    $2

  Nothing below this line is a measurement. The code exists, its pure parts
  are self-tested, and its cluster-facing parts are UNPROVEN: the defect class
  that already bit this directory three times (a flag on the wrong subcommand,
  a label split on the wrong separator, a cluster refused for want of a release
  channel) is exactly the class that only a real run finds.

  Re-run with --execute to actually provision and run it, and replace this
  banner with what happened.
