# Bring a leoflow control plane up on a throwaway GKE cluster, the same shape
# that was installed by hand on k3d: Postgres and Redis as plain Deployments,
# then `helm install` against the published server image.
#
# WHAT THIS IS NOT. These datastores are Deployments with `emptyDir` storage and
# one replica. They are not a reference deployment and nothing here should be
# copied into one: a restarted Postgres pod loses the database. That is correct
# for a bounded experiment whose cluster is deleted at the end, and it is a data
# loss bug anywhere else. It is also a thing the experiments CANNOT see: nothing
# below measures a managed Postgres, its connection limits, or its latency, so
# no result from these runners says anything about either.
#
# ONE CORRECTION TO THE RECIPE. The hand install was described as passing
# `auth.agentTLS.enabled=false`. That value cannot install the 0.4.7 chart: the
# chart FAILS THE RENDER on it, by design, at
# helm/leoflow/templates/deployment.yaml:41 (added in b5aea55, present in the
# v0.4.7 tag). The message is explicit that the Pro edition refuses to boot
# without a gRPC cert, so turning TLS off yields a CrashLoopBackOff rather than
# a plaintext deployment, and the chart would rather refuse than render that.
# So this file uses `agentTLS.autoGenerate=true`, which is the chart default and
# needs neither cert-manager nor a pre-created Secret.
#
# Sourced, never executed, except for --self-test.
