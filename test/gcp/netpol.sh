# netpol: prove, or fail to prove, #1089's standing NetworkPolicy rows on a CNI
# that actually enforces.
#
# WHY THIS CANNOT BE DONE LOCALLY. k3d's kindnet ACCEPTS a NetworkPolicy object
# and never enforces it. So every assertion of the form "the task pod cannot
# reach X" passes on k3d whether or not the policy works, whether or not the
# podSelector matches, and whether or not the chart rendered anything at all.
# test/release/rc-cluster-validation.md §3b carries three rows in exactly that
# state, and #958 is a SECURITY POSTURE claim: if `allowMetadataEgress` does not
# really scope to one host, the documentation is wrong whether or not a release
# is in flight.
#
# THE VACUOUS-PASS PROBLEM, AND WHAT IS DONE ABOUT IT. "The pod could not reach
# the metadata server" is not evidence of anything on its own. It is equally
# produced by:
#
#   - a CNI that enforces and dropped the packet          (the finding)
#   - a CNI that does not enforce, and a host that is
#     simply not there on this cloud                      (vacuous)
#   - a probe image whose `nc` does not do what we think  (vacuous)
#   - a pod that never got the policy's labels            (vacuous)
#
# So nothing here asserts a block until three things are established first:
#
#   1. THE DATAPLANE IS WHAT WE THINK. datapathProvider is ADVANCED_DATAPATH and
#      the Dataplane V2 node agent is actually Ready on every node. A cluster
#      that silently came up on the legacy datapath makes the whole run vacuous,
#      so the run STOPS here rather than reporting passes.
#   2. THE TARGET IS REACHABLE WITH NO POLICY AT ALL. Probed before anything is
#      applied. A host that does not answer at baseline can never demonstrate a
#      block, and any row that depends on it is reported UNPROVABLE rather than
#      passed.
#   3. A DROP IS DISTINGUISHED FROM A REFUSAL. A NetworkPolicy drop is silent:
#      the connection hangs to the timeout. A closed port answers instantly with
#      a reset. Collapsing those two into "failed to connect" is precisely how a
#      host that was never listening reads as a policy win, so every probe is
#      TIMED and classified ALLOWED / DROPPED / REFUSED.
#
# AND THE CONTROL THAT MAKES IT A MEASUREMENT. Two probe pods run side by side
# in the task namespace for the whole run:
#
#   probe-task   carries leoflow.io/run-id, which is what the chart's task
#                policy selects (helm/leoflow/templates/task-networkpolicy.yaml
#                selects on `leoflow.io/run-id Exists`).
#   probe-plain  identical, WITHOUT that label. Nothing selects it, ever.
#
# The finding is the DIFFERENCE between them at the same instant on the same
# cluster. probe-plain keeping its access is what rules out "the metadata server
# went away", "the node lost egress", and "the cloud is having a moment", none
# of which a single-pod probe can separate from enforcement.
#
# Usage:
#   test/gcp/netpol.sh                 # print the plan and the cost, create nothing
#   test/gcp/netpol.sh --execute       # provision, run, and ALWAYS tear down
