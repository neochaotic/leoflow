#
# pod-per-task: drive rising concurrency until something saturates, and say
# WHICH thing saturated.
#
# WHY. The local soak runs `leoflow lite --executor subprocess`, so the entire
# Kubernetes executor path is unmeasured: pod-per-task, image pulls, the pod
# informer, the reaper acting on pods. That is the path production runs.
#
# THE QUESTION IS NOT "how fast is it". A single latency number would be the
# least useful thing this could produce. There are four candidate ceilings and
# they have four completely different remedies:
#
#   scheduler tick   leoflow decided late.        Remedy: tick interval, batch
#                                                 size, scheduler replicas (ADR 0049 split).
#   API server       the pod CREATE itself slowed. Remedy: client QPS/burst,
#                                                 fewer writes, a bigger control plane.
#   image pull       the kubelet waited on a pull. Remedy: pre-pull, a closer
#                                                 registry, a smaller image.
#   node capacity    the pod sat Pending.          Remedy: more or bigger nodes.
#
# Sending an operator to the wrong one of those costs more than the experiment.
# So every pod is decomposed into four phases, each level is judged per phase,
# and the answer is the phase whose wall appears at the LOWEST concurrency. A
# tie is reported as a tie (see lib/stats.sh) rather than resolved by argument
# order, because "the API server and image pulls went together" is a real answer.
#
# WHAT "SATURATED" MEANS IS DECIDED IN lib/stats.sh, BEFORE ANY RUN. p95 at this
# level >= 3x the p95 at the lowest level, AND the level before it already >= 2x.
# The second clause is what separates a wall from a shared-cloud spike. A level
# with fewer than 20 samples is inconclusive whatever its p95 says. Those
# constants are in code, self-tested, and were written before a cluster existed.
#
# ───────────────────────── WHAT THIS EXPERIMENT CANNOT SEE ─────────────────────
#
# Stated here rather than discovered by a reader later:
#
# 1. TIMESTAMP RESOLUTION. PodScheduled, Pulled and `state.running.startedAt`
#    are RFC3339 with ONE SECOND resolution in the Kubernetes API. Every
#    per-pod phase below is therefore quantized to a second. A rise from 1s to
#    2s is inside the quantization and this runner refuses to call it
#    saturation; the run records the baseline and REPORTS IT AS UNRELIABLE when
#    the baseline p95 is under RESOLUTION_FLOOR. Only the submit phase, timed
#    client-side, has sub-second resolution.
# 2. A SHARED CLOUD. Zonal GKE on e2 machines is shared, burstable hardware.
#    One run is one sample of one afternoon. Nothing here separates "leoflow
#    saturated" from "this zone was busy", which is why the raw series is kept
#    and why a re-run is the only way to make the number mean anything. Two runs
#    that disagree is a finding; one run is a reading.
# 3. THE SCHEDULER TICK, IN --k8s-only MODE. That mode drives pods directly and
#    has no leoflow in it at all, so the `dispatch` phase is NOT MEASURED and is
#    reported as such, never as zero. It bounds the other three.
# 4. NODE AUTO-REPAIR. A release channel is now mandatory (GKE refuses a cluster
#    without one), and a channel enforces auto-upgrade. A node replaced
#    mid-run looks exactly like node capacity saturating, so node ages are
#    recorded and a node younger than the run is flagged.
# 5. IMAGE PULL, AFTER THE FIRST LEVEL. The kubelet caches. Level 1 pays the
#    pull and later levels do not, so a FALLING pull latency across levels is
#    the cache, not an improvement. Each level can be forced back to a cold
#    pull with --cold-pull, which uses a distinct image tag per level.
#
# Usage:
#   test/gcp/pod-per-task.sh                       # plan + cost, creates nothing
#   test/gcp/pod-per-task.sh --execute --k8s-only  # the Kubernetes half, no leoflow
#   test/gcp/pod-per-task.sh --execute             # the full path (needs DAG images)

it means the ceiling is ABOVE the top level, and where it is remains unknown.
