# Provision a throwaway GKE cluster for the three experiments a local k3d cannot
# run, and make it impossible to forget.
#
# The cost of these experiments is not the experiment. A four-hour window at the
# default shape is about USD 2; the same cluster left up for a month is about
# USD 360, and ten nodes left for a month is about USD 1,040. Both figures come
# from estimate_usd below, not from prose, so they cannot drift apart from what
# the script prints. That is two orders of magnitude, so every guardrail here is
# aimed at the second number, not the first.
#
# THE GUARDRAIL THAT MATTERS is --max-run-duration on the NODE POOL. It is a
# node-pool flag: `gcloud container clusters create` does not accept it, so the
# TTL is applied by a second call after the cluster exists, and read back before
# the script reports success. If it cannot be applied, the cluster is deleted
# immediately rather than left unbounded.
#
# What the API promises is that the nodes stop existing: NodeConfig.maxRunDuration
# is documented as "the maximum duration for the nodes to exist. If unspecified,
# the nodes can exist indefinitely." Whether GKE then REPLACES an expired node to
# hold the pool at its target size was the open question, and it is now answered
# by observation: it does not. An hour after a 30m TTL expired, the node pool
# still reported initialNodeCount 1 while its managed instance group was at
# size 0 / targetSize 0 and the project had no GCE instances at all. The MIG
# target is taken to zero rather than the node being recreated.
#
# The same observation confirms the limit of the guardrail: that cluster object
# was still RUNNING, and billing the control-plane fee, an hour after its last
# node was gone. The TTL bounds the NODE bill and nothing else, so treat it as
# the backstop it is and not as a substitute for the teardown.
# Everything else below is defense in depth on top of it.
#
# Nothing about the account is in this file. Project, zone and billing come from
# the environment or from `gcloud config`, and the script refuses to guess.

# The argv is built in a function, and never inline at the call site, so the
# self-test can read it without creating anything. That is the only way to check
# a flag before a bill does, and the first version of this script needed it: it
# passed --max-run-duration to `container clusters create`, where that flag DOES
# NOT EXIST. It is a node-pool flag (`container node-pools create|update`), so
# the create would have failed outright and the guardrail the whole directory is
# built around was never going to be applied at all.
# A RELEASE CHANNEL IS NOW MANDATORY. This create used to pass
# --no-enable-autoupgrade --no-enable-autorepair and no channel at all, which
# GKE refused outright on 2026-09-20:
#
#   code=400 ... not enrolling clusters in a release channel is now only allowed
#   for existing customers. New customers can use a release channel ...
#
# So nothing could be provisioned at all, which is a defect only a real create
# finds: the flags were individually valid and the argv self-test passed.
# `--release-channel regular` replaces BOTH old flags rather than joining them,
# because a channel enforces node auto-upgrade and GKE rejects the pair.
#
# The cost of that is real and worth stating: auto-upgrade and auto-repair are
# now ON, so GKE may recreate a node mid-experiment. Over a window of a few
# hours that is unlikely, but it is a CONFOUND for the saturation run rather
# than a neutral setting, and a node replacement there would look exactly like
# node capacity saturating. The saturation runner records node ages for that

  Delete it the moment you are done, do not wait for the TTL:

      test/gcp/teardown.sh $CLUSTER

  The node TTL removes the expensive part. The control plane keeps billing at
  about USD $GKE_MGMT_HOURLY an hour until the CLUSTER is deleted, so the TTL is
  the safety net and the teardown is still the job.
