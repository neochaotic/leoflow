# warm-pool-ab: measure what warm pools (ADR 0058) actually buy, on the only
# executor that has them.
#
# WHY IT NEEDS A CLUSTER. Warm pools exist only in the Kubernetes executor.
# Lite's subprocess executor has no pool at all, so the local soak cannot see
# this feature even in principle.
#
# ─────────────────── THIS IS NOT A ONE-VARIABLE COMPARISON ───────────────────
#
# Turning warm pools on is not a single flag. The chart REFUSES to render
# unless two other settings move with it, and the server enforces the same
# coupling at boot, so an install that changed only one would CrashLoopBackOff
# rather than run:
#
#   helm/leoflow/templates/deployment.yaml:199-201
#     "execution.warmPoolsEnabled requires auth.agentTokenTransport=exchange
#      AND auth.secretLivenessMode=enforce"
#
# The reason is a real security invariant, not an accident of configuration
# (ADR 0058 D2): a warm pod outlives the attempt it was created for, so a
# credential that outlives an attempt would let a SUPERSEDED attempt still
# resolve secrets. `exchange` gives each attempt a token that dies with it, and
# `enforce` denies secret delivery to an attempt that is no longer live.
#
# So "warm pools on" is really THREE changes at once:
#
#   execution.warmPoolsEnabled   false -> true    the feature
#   auth.agentTokenTransport     envvar -> exchange   a different auth path for
#                                                EVERY task pod, warm or not:
#                                                a projected ServiceAccount
#                                                token traded via a
#                                                control-plane TokenReview
#   auth.secretLivenessMode      observe -> enforce   a liveness check on every
#                                                secret delivery
#
# A two-arm A/B across that bundle CANNOT attribute a difference to warm pools.
# The exchange transport alone adds a TokenReview round trip to every pod start,
# which pushes the measured number in the OPPOSITE direction to the one warm
# pools are supposed to move it. Reporting "warm pools made it faster" from such
# a comparison would be wrong even if the number were right.
#
# THE FIX IS A THIRD ARM, and it is the reason this file exists rather than a
# two-arm script:
#
#   A   envvar   + observe + warm OFF   today's default posture
#   A'  exchange + enforce + warm OFF   the coupled prerequisites, WITHOUT the
#                                       feature. This is the real control.
#   B   exchange + enforce + warm ON    the feature
#
#   B vs A'  isolates warm pools. ONE variable. This is the scientific result.
#   B vs A   is what an operator actually experiences when they "turn on warm
#            pools", bundle and all. This is the operational result.
#   A' vs A  is the price of the prerequisites on their own, which is the number
#            nobody has and which decides whether the bundle is worth it when
#            the pool misses.
#
# Both differences are reported, separately and labeled. Neither is called "the
# warm pool speedup" on its own.
#
# ─────────────────────────── ORDERING IS A CONFOUND ──────────────────────────
#
# The arms run sequentially on one cluster, because three clusters costs three
# times as much and introduces a bigger confound than the one it removes. But
# sequential arms drift: the image is cached after arm A, the nodes are warm,
# the zone's neighbours change. So the order is A, A', B, then A AGAIN, and the
# two A measurements are compared to each other. If they disagree by more than
# DRIFT_TOLERANCE, the cluster drifted under the experiment and the A/B
# difference is reported as UNTRUSTWORTHY rather than as a result.
#
# ──────────────────────────── WHAT IT CANNOT SEE ─────────────────────────────
#
# - Pool behavior under eviction, preemption or node loss. Nothing here kills a
#   node, so the reclaim path (ADR 0058 N1b) is not exercised.
# - Multi-tenant contention. One tenant, one dag_version. maxPoolSize and the
#   per-tenant ceiling (M4) are not pressured.
# - Steady state. The run is minutes, and idleTtl / maxAttempts / maxLifetime
#   recycling are all longer than that, so recycle is NOT measured.
# - The cold-start distribution of a real DAG image. The image here is a small
#   fixture; a 2 GB DAG image changes the arithmetic entirely and in warm pools'
#   favor, so any speedup measured here is a LOWER bound for heavy images and
#   says nothing about light ones being representative.
#
# Usage:
#   test/gcp/warm-pool-ab.sh                 # plan + cost, creates nothing
#   test/gcp/warm-pool-ab.sh --execute       # provision, run all arms, tear down

  # THE STEP THE PREVIOUS SCRIPT NEVER HAD.
  #
  # test/soak/warmpool-ab.sh never built or pushed the DAG images it needed, so
  # every trigger it made would have 404'd against a dag_id the control plane
  # had never been told about: an empty series, and three arms that all
  # measured nothing equally well.
  #
  # PROVEN: the build-and-push below has been run for real. From an arm64 Mac it
  # produced linux/amd64 and pushed it to Artifact Registry:
  #   us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/<project>/leoflow-validate/gcp-probe:gcpexp1
  #   sha256:ee3708486dc3ed224bb91d615f30c36ef0f81397e35b4256c90fde3d6ad22f92
  # The platform pin in test/gcp/dags/gcp_probe/leoflow.yaml is what makes that
  # work; without it the image is arm64 and every task pod fails with an exec
  # format error AFTER the cluster has been paid for.
  #
  # That image was DELETED again after it was verified. An Artifact Registry
  # repository outlives every cluster that pulled from it, carries none of the
  # labels that make deleting a cluster safe, and `teardown.sh --leftovers` can
  # therefore only ever LIST it. A first real run rebuilds and repushes, which
  # is a few minutes and the correct default; leaving an image behind to save
  # them is how a registry becomes a bill nobody remembers agreeing to.
  #
  # NOT PROVEN: everything from the login onward. It has never run against a
  # control plane, and the defect class that has already bitten this directory
  # four times (a flag on the wrong subcommand, a label split on the wrong
  # separator, a missing release channel, an empty-array expansion under bash

  The three arms, and why there are three:

    A       $(arm_values A)
    A'      $(arm_values Aprime)
    B       $(arm_values B)

    B vs A'   isolates warm pools            ONE variable
    B vs A    what an operator experiences   THREE variables
    A' vs A   the price of the prerequisites TWO variables

  Turning warm pools on is not a one-flag change. The chart refuses to render
  without agentTokenTransport=exchange AND secretLivenessMode=enforce
  (helm/leoflow/templates/deployment.yaml:199-201), and the server enforces the
  same coupling at boot. Any two-arm comparison across that bundle cannot
  attribute a difference to warm pools, which is why arm A' exists.

  Run order: $RUN_ORDER  (arm A twice, to measure drift rather than assume none)
