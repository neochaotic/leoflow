# Upgrade-in-place smoke for the release gate (#150 / ADR 0033).
#
# Installs the PREVIOUS non-draft prerelease, runs `leoflow version` to prove
# the old binary is healthy, then installs the CURRENT tag and asserts the new
# version is in place + the binary still runs. Catches the class of bug where
# install.sh handles a fresh box but breaks on top of an existing ~/.leoflow/
# (stale config, stale pysrc, leftover PATH entries, etc.) — the failure mode
# the user would otherwise hit on `leoflow upgrade`.
#
# Required env:
#   LEOFLOW_REPO     — "owner/name"     (typically ${GITHUB_REPOSITORY})
#   LEOFLOW_VERSION  — the just-pushed tag we are gating
#   GH_TOKEN         — used by `gh release list` (auto in GitHub Actions)
#
# Run in a clean container (the release workflow does this; locally use
# `docker run --rm -it -e LEOFLOW_REPO=... ubuntu:24.04 bash`).
