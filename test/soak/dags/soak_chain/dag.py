"""soak_chain: the sequential-dependency shape of the soak battery.

Shape: a 10-deep chain, alternating BashOperator (which Leoflow compiles to its
native `bash` task type) and a TaskFlow @task (the native `python` type). Every
hop is one scheduler decision that can only be taken after the previous task went
terminal, so a run's wall-clock is dominated by 10 x (dispatch latency + tick
interval), not by the work. That makes this the most sensitive DAG in the battery
to a scheduler whose tick is slowing down: the ingest and fan-out DAGs hide a
slow tick behind their own runtime, this one does not.

The bodies are deliberately trivial (an echo, a print). Making them heavy would
only add noise to the measurement this DAG exists for.

The five python hops are five separate functions rather than one decorated
function reused with `.override(task_id=...)`: Leoflow's parser shim (ADR 0024)
implements the `@task` decorator itself and its returned object has no
`.override`, so a DAG written the Airflow way fails to compile with
`AttributeError: 'function' object has no attribute 'override'`.

Task types exercised: `bash` (native, from BashOperator), `python` (native).
