"""soak_operators: the non-native execution path of the soak battery.

Everything here compiles to Leoflow's `airflow_operator` task type, which is the
path with the most moving parts: the runtime has to resolve a class path, import
a provider package, construct the operator, hand it a Leoflow-managed Connection
rendered as an AIRFLOW_CONN_* env var, and execute it. A native `python` task
touches none of that. Over a long run the question this DAG answers is whether
that path degrades differently from the native one: whether resolution cost
stays flat, and whether anything a provider import leaves behind accumulates.

Every endpoint is local by construction:

* `http_get` points at the soak fixture server on 127.0.0.1 (test/soak/fixture),
  through the managed Connection `soak_http`. No public API is contacted, on
  purpose: a weekend of requests against a stranger's service is not something
  we do, and an outage on their side would teach us nothing about our scheduler.
* `sql_upsert` / `sql_count` point at the soak Postgres container through the
  managed Connection `soak_pg`, into its own `soak_warehouse` database, so the
  workload never shares a table with Leoflow's own metadata.
* `wait_a_moment` is a reschedule-mode HttpSensor pointed at the fixture's
  `/fixture/ready` endpoint, which answers 404 for the first three pokes of a
  given run and 200 after that. It is in the battery because `up_for_reschedule`
  is a scheduler state with its own re-dispatch path, and a DAG that never enters
  it would leave that path uncovered for the whole run. A DateTimeSensor would
  have been the obvious choice and does not work here: its `target_time` needs a
  future timestamp, and Leoflow renders neither `{{ macros.* }}` nor anything
  else that could compute one, so the template reaches the provider verbatim and
  fails inside pendulum. The fixture-counter approach needs no clock and repeats
  identically on every run.

Task types exercised: `airflow_operator` (non-native) throughout, plus one
native `python` task to anchor the comparison inside the same run.
