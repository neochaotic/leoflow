#
# One command provisions everything, runs a realistic scheduled workload, asserts
# invariants continuously, collects the evidence and tears down. It is safe to
# leave unattended: it has a wall-clock ceiling, a disk budget and a kill switch,
# and every artifact it produces is written as it goes, not at the end.

Flags:
  --duration D      wall-clock ceiling as Ns/Nm/Nh/Nd (default 30m, hard max 72h)
  --faults PLAN     none | standard | selftest-red | "kind:dur:offset,..."
  --mode MODE       soak (default) | credential-ceiling. credential-ceiling
                    lowers auth.max_attempt_credential_lifetime and requires
                    soak_token to FAIL because its credential lapsed. It is an
                    inverted run: green means the bound was NOT enforced.
  --label NAME      label recorded in every sample (default soak)
  --out DIR         evidence directory (default .soak/<timestamp>)
  --keep-db         do not stop the Postgres container on teardown
  --purge           also delete the Postgres volume on teardown (destroys history)
  --no-fresh        keep the existing soak database instead of resetting it
  --rows N          rows the ingest DAG generates per run (default 400000)
  -h, --help        this text

Fault kinds:
  pgpause:DUR       docker pause the soak Postgres for DUR, then unpause
  sigstop:DUR       SIGSTOP the control-plane process for DUR, then SIGCONT
  restart           SIGKILL the control plane and start it again
  overrun:DUR       declare a 45s fault window but pause Postgres for DUR.
                    This is the deliberately-red self test: a real fault that
                    outlives the window the harness claimed for it.
