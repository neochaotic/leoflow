Everything about writing DAGs for Leoflow. A DAG is a `dag.py` on the Airflow Task
SDK plus a `leoflow.yaml` for packaging and bindings, compiled to one immutable
artifact.

New to authoring? Start with **[DAG authoring](/author-dags/dag-authoring/)** for
the project layout and compile model, then reach for the guide that matches your
task below.
