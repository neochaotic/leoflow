description: Expose Variables and Connections to your task pods.
---

Leoflow stores **Variables** and **Connections** in the control plane (connection
secrets encrypted at rest, AES-256-GCM — ADR 0019) and delivers them to task pods
at runtime as environment variables, so your task reads them with the **native
Airflow APIs** *and* as plain env (ADR 0021).

{{% alert title="Tenancy" color="info" %}}
Tenancy is single-tenant on Lite; Pro adds multi-tenant isolation. The agent
injects the current tenant's Variables/Connections per
[ADR 0019](/project/adrs/0019-secret-encryption-at-rest/).
{{% /alert %}}

## Manage them
Via the Airflow-compatible UI (Admin → Variables / Connections) or the API:

```bash
# Variable
curl -X POST "$LEOFLOW_SERVER/api/v2/variables" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"key":"greeting","value":"hello"}'

# Connection (password + extra are encrypted at rest)
curl -X POST "$LEOFLOW_SERVER/api/v2/connections" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"connection_id":"warehouse","conn_type":"postgres","host":"db","login":"u","password":"p","schema":"analytics"}'
```

## In the UI: connection types & editing

The Admin → Connections form offers a catalog of common connection types
(borrowed from Airflow's providers — Postgres, MySQL, HTTP, AWS, Google Cloud,
Snowflake, Redis, SSH, …); pick one and edit the fields it needs.

The form renders the standard fields for the chosen type (host, login, password,
port, schema, description) plus an Extra JSON block, and an existing connection
opens pre-filled (the password is write-only and never returned):

## Test a connection

The **Test** button (`POST /api/v2/connections/test`) checks the endpoint's
reachability **from the control plane** — an HTTP(S) request, or a TCP dial to
`host:port` (the type's well-known port when none is set) — and returns
`{status, message}`. Note this tests from the control plane, not the task pod, so
a host only resolvable inside the cluster (e.g. `host.k3d.internal` in dev) reads
as unreachable there even though pods can reach it. Full per-provider credential
validation needs the provider hooks (a later addition).

## Declare what a task consumes

A task doesn't automatically get the value just because it exists on the
control plane — the DAG that consumes a Variable or Connection should
**declare** it in `leoflow.yaml`, the same consumption-declared model
[declared secrets](/project/adrs/0045-declared-secret-delivery/) use:

```yaml
# leoflow.yaml
dag_id: sales_report
variables:
  - greeting
connections:
  - warehouse
```

The three-step flow is: **create** the Variable/Connection (UI or API, above) →
**declare** it in `leoflow.yaml` → **read** it in the task (below).

{{% alert title="What declaring actually controls today" color="warning" %}}
The control plane's secret-delivery policy (`auth.secret_scoping`, [ADR
0055](/project/adrs/0055-secret-scoping-and-token-liveness/)) has two modes:

- **`permissive`** (the shipped default) delivers the **whole tenant vault** to
  every task regardless of declaration, and only logs a warning when a task's
  declared set is narrower than what it received. An **undeclared** Variable or
  Connection still resolves — `Variable.get` does **not** return empty under
  this default.
- **`enforce`** delivers **only** the declared subset — an undeclared name is
  not delivered, and `Variable.get`/`BaseHook.get_connection` for it comes back
  empty/missing, exactly like a declared-secrets task that requested nothing.

**Declare anyway, even under `permissive`.** It documents your DAG's real
dependencies, matches how a deploy already warns you about missing
*connections* (see [Deploy your first Pro DAG](/operate/first-pro-dag/#when-it-doesnt-work)),
and is what makes the DAG portable to a tenant running `enforce` — the
direction least-privilege delivery is headed (tracked in
[#59](https://github.com/neochaotic/leoflow/issues/59)). An operator sets the
policy cluster-wide; it is never a DAG-author setting.

## Read them in a task
The agent injects each tenant's Variables/Connections before running your code:

- `AIRFLOW_VAR_<KEY>` (uppercased) → `Variable.get("key")`
- `AIRFLOW_CONN_<ID>` (a connection URI, with `extra` carried under `__extra__`) → `BaseHook.get_connection("id")`

```python
from airflow.sdk import task

@task
def use_secrets():
    import os
    from airflow.sdk import Variable          # native Airflow API
    print(Variable.get("greeting"))           # "hello"
    print(os.environ["AIRFLOW_VAR_GREETING"]) # also a plain env var
```

Scope is global (per tenant). Delivery requires a secure agent channel (TLS, #58)
or, in dev, the explicit `LEOFLOW_AGENT_ALLOW_INSECURE_SECRETS=true` (set by
`leoflow lite`). Pro on Kubernetes (including GKE) **requires** TLS — the chart
ships `agentTLS.enabled: true` by default and the server refuses the insecure
bypass; the plaintext escape hatch is Lite-only, for local iteration. See
[ADR 0021](/project/adrs/0021-exposing-variables-connections-to-pods/).
