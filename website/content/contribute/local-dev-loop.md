description: Two inner loops for working on Leoflow from source — the leoflow lite hot-reload loop for DAGs, and make lite-redeploy for Go changes.
---

Working on Leoflow from source has **two inner loops**, and you pick by what you
changed:

- **Iterating on a DAG** (Python/YAML) — use the
  [`leoflow lite` hot-reload loop](#the-leoflow-lite-hot-reload-loop): save a file,
  the watcher recompiles and registers a new version in seconds.
- **Iterating on the control plane, agent, or CLI** (Go) — use
  [`make lite-redeploy`](#redeploying-go-changes-make-lite-redeploy): it rebuilds all
  three binaries, swaps them in lockstep, and reboots `leoflow lite`.

Neither loop goes near `git tag` or the release pipeline — that keeps release tags
clean.

## The `leoflow lite` hot-reload loop

`leoflow lite` runs the whole stack locally — control plane, the embedded Airflow
UI, and a real executor — against an **isolated local database**, and
**hot-reloads on every save**. The UI is served on a Lite port (default
**8088**), marked with the **LITE** badge, so it never collides with a demo or
production instance.

This page is the **from-source** loop for working on Leoflow itself:

```bash
make dev-install            # build + put leoflow / server / agent on your PATH
leoflow lite provision          # provision local dev deps (base image, local DB)
leoflow init dags/my_dag    # scaffold a project
leoflow lite dags/my_dag    # hot-reload at http://localhost:8088 (marked LITE)
```

{{% alert title="Login" color="info" %}}
If you ran [`leoflow setup`](/get-started/installation/#what-leoflow-setup-does) (the
end-user installer does), Lite enforces a real **admin login** — recover it
with `leoflow lite reset-password`. A bare source checkout without that
config falls back to no-auth (loopback only) with a warning, for a quick loop.
{{% /alert %}}

(End users install Lite with one command — see [Installation](/get-started/installation/).)

{{% alert title="Reaching Lite from another machine" color="info" %}}
Lite binds **loopback** (`127.0.0.1`) by default, so the UI opens on the
machine running it. To reach it from your internal network/VPN (e.g. a
headless box), pass `--host 0.0.0.0` — **only with a configured admin login**
(a no-auth instance is always forced back to loopback) and only on a trusted
network. Otherwise, an SSH tunnel works without exposing anything:
`ssh -L 8088:localhost:8088 <host>`.
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert title="Edit in the browser" color="success" %}}
Lite includes a small built-in code editor (Python/YAML highlighting, file
tree) — click the **IDE** button in the UI, or open `/ide`. See
[The Lite web editor](/author-dags/lite-web-editor/).
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert title="Removing a DAG" color="info" %}}
Two ways to deregister a DAG from the Lite registry:

- **Delete the project directory** — the watcher's per-tick set-diff
  notices the project vanished from disk and calls the control plane's
  hard-delete endpoint (cascades versions, runs, task instances, XCom).
  Logged on stderr: `✗ removed dag "my_dag" from registry (folder gone)`.
- **`leoflow lite forget <dag_id>`** — explicit deregister via the Lite
  DB. Use it to remove a DAG without touching the source files (e.g.
  paused work on an example you'll come back to). Flags: `--all`
  (deregister everything), `--dry-run` (print what would be removed).

Both paths go through the same FK cascade — versions, runs, TIs, XCom
are all dropped atomically with the `dags` row.
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert title="Per-DAG venvs (subprocess executor)" color="info" %}}
Each DAG gets its own virtualenv under `~/.leoflow/dev/venvs/<dag_id>/`, so
editing one project's `dependencies:` only re-runs pip for **that** DAG —
other DAGs' venvs are untouched. Two DAGs can pin **conflicting** versions
of the same package without interfering. If
[`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) is on `PATH`, Lite uses it for the
install (5–10× faster cold runs); otherwise it falls back to `pip` from
the venv. The k3d executor is unaffected — each DAG already ships in its
own image.
{{% /alert %}}

### Two executors

| `--executor` | What it does | Reload to a new version |
|---|---|---|
| `k8s` (default) | Real pod-per-task on a dedicated, isolated k3d cluster (`leoflow-dev`); rebuilds the DAG image each change — highest fidelity. | **~8 s** (code-only change, layer cache warm) |
| `subprocess` | Tasks run unsandboxed on the host venv; no image build — the fast inner loop. | **~1–2 s** |

These numbers are the time from **save** to the **new version registered in the
control plane** (measured against the `lifecycle` example).

### Choosing an executor

There are **only these two** — and deliberately **no Docker executor**
([ADR 0015](/project/adrs/0015-kubernetes-only-execution/)).
A Docker-socket executor would mean importing the Docker Go SDK
(`github.com/docker/docker`), which carries an unfixable advisory (Moby AuthZ
bypass, GO-2026-4887) reachable from the control-plane binary — it would fail the
security gate (ADR 0014) — and talking to the Docker socket is itself a
root-equivalent privilege-escalation surface. So **Kubernetes is the sole
container path** (the same `KubernetesExecutor` locally and in production), and
**subprocess is a dev-only, unisolated escape hatch**. Docker, when installed, is
only the engine that hosts the local k3d cluster — never an executor.

| | `subprocess` | `k8s` (k3d / prod) |
|---|---|---|
| Speed (per task, reload) | fastest — host process, no build | slower — image build + pod schedule |
| Isolation | **none** (shared host venv) | real pods (limits, RBAC) |
| Pro fidelity | low | **high** (identical path to prod) |
| Moving parts that can break | few (just the venv) | more (cluster, scheduler, registry, PVC) |
| Shared `/staging` volume (ADR 0022) | **not provided** (`LEOFLOW_STAGING_DIR` unset; tasks have direct host-disk access instead) | **yes** — per-run PVC at `/staging`, `LEOFLOW_STAGING_DIR` set, GC'd |

Rule of thumb: iterate on DAG logic in **`subprocess`** (instant loop), then
validate in **`k8s`** before deploy — especially anything that uses the staging
volume, resource limits, Connections injection, or other pod-only behavior, since
those only exist on the Kubernetes path.

### The edit → reload → see-it cycle

On save, the watcher recompiles and registers a **new DAG version** in seconds.
But one thing trips people up:

{{% alert title="The page does not auto-refresh DAG structure — reload it" color="warning" %}}
The hot reload is of the **backend** (recompile + register), not of the open
browser tab. A new version (added/removed task, changed code) appears in the
control plane in ~1–2 s, but the **open page keeps showing the old structure
until you reload it** (Cmd/Ctrl-R).
{{% /alert %}}

| What changed | Updates in the open page automatically? |
|---|---|
| **DAG structure / version** — task added/removed, code edited | ❌ No — reload the page |
| **Run state** — a task going green/red during a run | ✅ Yes — Airflow's auto-refresh handles it |

#### Gotcha: a `@task` only appears when you call it

In the Airflow TaskFlow API, defining a task is not enough — it joins the graph
only when **called inside the `with DAG(...)` block**:

```python
@task
def validate() -> None: ...

with DAG("my_dag", ...):
    load(transform(extract()))
    validate()      # ← without this call, `validate` never shows up in the graph
```

If a task you expected is missing, check that it is *called* — then reload the page.

### When a DAG is broken

Edit a DAG into a parse/compile error (a stray syntax error, a bad import) and the
watcher refuses to register the broken version — the last good version keeps
serving. The failure surfaces in **two** places:

**1. The dev terminal** prints the real traceback, with file and line:

```text
[22:13:52] change detected → reloading …
✗ running parser "python3 -m leoflow_parser": exit status 1
  File "examples/lifecycle/dag.py", line 51
    def broken(  # missing close paren
              ^
SyntaxError: '(' was never closed
```

**2. The Airflow home** lights up its native **Dag Import Error** banner (the same
mechanism real Airflow uses). The stat card turns red with the count:

![The home dashboard showing the red "Dag Import Error 1" card](/assets/screenshots/dev-import-error-home.png)

Open it to see the offending file, its bundle, and the full traceback:

![The Dag Import Error detail listing the broken file and its traceback](/assets/screenshots/dev-import-error-detail.png)

Fix the file and save — the watcher registers the next good version and the banner
**clears automatically** (~2 s). No restart, no manual cleanup.

{{% alert title="Lite vs Pro" color="info" %}}
This banner is driven by a control-plane feed (`GET /api/v2/importErrors`) and
works in any environment. In **Pro** you rarely see it: DAGs are
immutable artifacts and a broken DAG fails `leoflow compile` in **CI** before it
is ever deployed — CI is the safety net there. In **Lite**, where you edit live,
the `leoflow lite` watcher publishes the error so you catch it in the UI, not
only the terminal.
{{% /alert %}}

### Where to look when something's wrong

- **Edited and nothing changed in the UI?** Reload the page (structure does not
  auto-refresh). If it's still wrong, check the terminal for `✗`.
- **A task is missing from the graph?** Make sure it is *called* inside the DAG,
  then reload.
- **`Dag Import Error` on the home?** Your DAG failed to parse — open the banner
  (or read the terminal) for the traceback, fix it, and save.
- **A task ran red?** That's a runtime failure, not a parse error — open the run
  and read the task logs.

### Local credentials — GCP, AWS, Azure

`leoflow lite`'s subprocess executor runs each task as a **local process under your
user**, inheriting your shell environment and `$HOME`. So your **local cloud
credentials just work** — no managed Connection needed for local dev:

- **GCP** — `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`, or Application Default Credentials
  (`gcloud auth application-default login` → `~/.config/gcloud`).
- **AWS** — `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`/`AWS_PROFILE` in the env, or `~/.aws/credentials`.
- **Azure** — `AZURE_*` in the env, or the Azure CLI cache (`~/.azure`).

The provider SDKs find these through their default credential chains, exactly as if
you ran the task by hand — so iterating on a DAG that touches your *real* cloud
accounts needs no extra credential wiring locally.

> In **Pro / cluster mode**, task pods are isolated and do **not** inherit your
> local env — there you deliver credentials through managed **Connections** (see
> [Variables & Connections](/author-dags/variables-connections/)). Same DAG, two credential
> sources: local env for the Lite loop, managed Connections in production.

### Resilience (self-healing)

Lite keeps its own state consistent without manual cleanup:

- **Stale state self-heals on boot.** If a reused metadata DB still carries DAGs or
  import errors from a previous run or workspace, on startup Lite reconciles them
  against your workspace — deregistering DAGs whose files are gone and clearing
  orphan import errors (fail-safe: if it cannot list the control plane, it removes
  nothing).
- **A DAG's per-DAG venv is reclaimed when the DAG is removed** (and re-created if
  it comes back), so virtualenvs don't pile up on disk.
- **Docker wedged? Lite still runs.** If Docker is present but unresponsive, Lite
  falls back to a Docker-free managed Postgres and the subprocess executor instead
  of aborting — or force it with `leoflow lite --postgres managed`.



## Redeploying Go changes (`make lite-redeploy`)

The fastest way to validate a change end-to-end against `leoflow lite` —
without going through `git tag`, the release pipeline, install-smoke, or
`curl | sh`. The script is `scripts/lite-redeploy.sh`, wired as a
Makefile target.

### When to use

- Validating a Go change in the control plane, the agent, or the CLI
  against a real `leoflow lite` boot.
- Reproducing a runtime bug a user reported, without round-tripping
  through the release machinery.
- Smoke-testing a fix BEFORE cutting a tag — keeps release tags clean.

This is **not** an install path. Real users still install via
`install.sh` from a published release (see `docs/installation.md`).

### What it does

1. **Builds** `leoflow`, `leoflow-server`, and `leoflow-agent` from the
   current working tree (no `git tag` needed).
2. **Ad-hoc code-signs** the binaries on macOS so the OS does not
   SIGKILL them at exec (Sequoia 14+ refuses to run an unsigned binary
   that carries `com.apple.provenance` — silent failure mode with
   exit 137 and no log output).
3. **Stops** any running `leoflow lite` (via the script's pidfile, with
   a `pkill -f "leoflow lite"` fallback).
4. **Swaps the binaries in both locations** `leoflow lite` resolves
   them from — `./bin/` (the repo's local bin, preferred by
   `resolveBinary` in `internal/cli/dev.go`) and `~/.leoflow/bin/` (the
   user-install location). Keeping them in lockstep is critical: if
   only one is updated the stale one silently runs and the dev loop
   becomes confusing fast (this happened — see the commit that added
   the script).
5. **Starts** `leoflow lite --postgres managed` (a docker-free local
   Postgres on a Unix socket, so the loop does not collide with any
   `postgres:16` you already have on 5432).
6. **Polls** `/readyz` and reports the boot URL + PID + log path.

### Usage

```sh
make lite-redeploy            # rebuild, restart, tail-ready
PORT=9090 make lite-redeploy  # custom HTTP port
LOG_LEVEL=debug make lite-redeploy   # verbose
```

After it returns:

```sh
# log tail (boot lines, http requests, executor activity)
tail -f /tmp/leoflow-lite.log

# get / rotate the admin password
~/.leoflow/bin/leoflow lite reset-password

# stop
kill "$(cat /tmp/leoflow-lite.pid)"
```

### The two-binary trap (why this script exists)

`leoflow lite` is a thin orchestrator: it spawns `leoflow-server` as a
subprocess. The Subprocess executor (the dev-only path that runs your
Python tasks) in turn spawns `leoflow-agent`. So a single `leoflow lite`
process tree uses **all three binaries**:

```
leoflow lite (CLI / orchestrator)
└── leoflow-server (control plane HTTP + gRPC + scheduler)
    └── leoflow-agent (per-task subprocess; runs the user's dag.py)
```

If you rebuild only `leoflow` (the CLI) but leave a stale `leoflow-server`
behind, lite still boots — but the control plane that actually handles
requests is the OLD code. Symptom: your code change "doesn't show up"
and you waste 30 minutes second-guessing the test. The script avoids
this by rebuilding and swapping all three on every invocation.

### How this fits the GitOps flow

| Layer | Tool | Triggered by | Validates |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Local dev loop** | `make lite-redeploy` | manual `make` | a change runs against a real `leoflow lite` |
| **PR CI** | `.github/workflows/ci.yaml` | `pull_request` | unit + integration + lint + e2e on the PR HEAD |
| **Release CI** | `.github/workflows/release.yaml` | `push: tags: v*` | the published binaries install, boot, and upgrade cleanly across 7 distros |

The local loop is the **inner ring** — it catches "does my change boot
at all" in seconds, before you push. The release smoke jobs are
designed for stable releases; they retract a published tag to a draft
on any failure. Using the local loop first keeps release tags clean
and avoids the retract / re-cut churn.

If you find yourself cutting a release tag purely to test a Lite change,
that is a smell — `make lite-redeploy` will give you the same
validation in seconds without burning a tag number.
