description: A guided walk from an empty project to a running DAG — scaffold, author, compile, run.

This is a hands-on tutorial. By the end you will have **authored and run a
three-task pipeline** — an `extract → transform → load` ETL that passes data
between tasks — and watched it go green in the Airflow-compatible UI.

You do not need to understand every concept up front; follow the steps in order
and it will work. The explanations come as you go.

{{% alert title="Before you start" color="info" %}}
Finish the [Quickstart](/get-started/quickstart/) first. You need **Leoflow Lite
installed** and the `leoflow` command on your `PATH` (`leoflow version` should
print a version). If `leoflow lite` is still running from the Quickstart, press
**Ctrl-C** to stop it — you will start it again in step 5.

## 1 · Scaffold a project

A Leoflow DAG project is just a directory with two files: **`dag.py`** (your
pipeline) and **`leoflow.yaml`** (how to package it). `leoflow init` creates that
pair for you:

```bash
leoflow init taskflow_sales
```

```
Initialized Leoflow project "taskflow_sales" in taskflow_sales

Next steps:
  leoflow validate taskflow_sales    # quick syntax check
  leoflow lite taskflow_sales        # run it locally with the embedded scheduler
```

The `dag_id` is taken from the directory name — `taskflow_sales`. Look inside:

```bash
ls taskflow_sales
# dag.py  leoflow.yaml
```

The scaffold is a one-task "hello" DAG. In the next two steps you will replace it
with the real pipeline.

## 2 · Write the pipeline

Open `taskflow_sales/dag.py` and replace its contents with this:

```python
"""taskflow_sales — a pure TaskFlow ETL passing data via XCom (no deps)."""
from __future__ import annotations

from airflow.sdk import DAG, task


@task
def extract() -> list[dict]:
    # A deterministic synthetic dataset (no I/O, so the example always runs).
    return [{"region": ["N", "S", "E", "W"][i % 4], "amount": (i * 37) % 1000} for i in range(1000)]


@task
def transform(rows: list[dict]) -> dict:
    by_region: dict[str, int] = {}
    for r in rows:
        by_region[r["region"]] = by_region.get(r["region"], 0) + r["amount"]
    print(f"transform: {len(rows)} rows -> {len(by_region)} regions")
    return by_region


@task
def load(totals: dict) -> None:
    top = max(totals, key=totals.get)
    print(f"load: totals {totals}; top region {top} = {totals[top]}")


with DAG("taskflow_sales", schedule=None, catchup=False, tags=["example"]):
    load(transform(extract()))
```

What you just wrote, top to bottom:

- **`from airflow.sdk import DAG, task`** — Leoflow runs the standard
  [Apache Airflow Task SDK](/author-dags/dag-authoring/). Your DAG source is
  ordinary Airflow 3 code.
- **`@task`** turns a plain Python function into a task. Its **return value is
  pushed to XCom** automatically, and when you pass one task's result as the
  argument to another, Leoflow **pulls it back** — that is the entire data-passing
  model here, no explicit XCom calls.
- **`with DAG(...)`** declares the DAG. `schedule=None` means it only runs when you
  trigger it (perfect for a tutorial); `tags=["example"]` groups it in the UI.
- **`load(transform(extract()))`** is the wiring. Reading it inside-out gives the
  dependency chain `extract → transform → load`; Leoflow builds the graph from
  those calls — you never draw edges by hand.

## 3 · Declare packaging

Open `taskflow_sales/leoflow.yaml` and make it match this. It tells Leoflow how to
build the DAG's image — here, nothing beyond a Python version, because the pipeline
has no third-party dependencies:

```yaml
schema_version: "1.0"
dag_id: taskflow_sales
description: Pure TaskFlow ETL passing data via XCom (no external deps).
owner: examples
tags:
  - example
python_version: "3.11"
dependencies: []
```

If your pipeline imported a library (say `pandas`), you would add it under
`dependencies:` and Leoflow would bake it into the image. See
[Configuration](/reference/configuration/) for every key.

## 4 · Validate it

Before running, check the project parses and matches the schema:

```bash
leoflow validate taskflow_sales
```

A clean run prints no errors. If you mistyped something in `leoflow.yaml` or
`dag.py`, this is where you find out — fix it and rerun until it passes.

## 5 · Run it

Start Lite pointed at your project:

```bash
leoflow lite taskflow_sales
```

Lite brings up its datastore, registers the DAG, and prints where to go:

```
✓ Leoflow Lite is ready
    open:    http://127.0.0.1:8088
    login:   admin@leoflow.local
    project: /path/to/taskflow_sales
```

Leave it running — it **hot-reloads** every time you save `dag.py`.

Open **http://127.0.0.1:8088**, log in (the password is the one Quickstart printed;
`leoflow lite reset-password` resets it), and `taskflow_sales` is in the **Dags**
list.

## 6 · Trigger your first run

1. Click **taskflow_sales** to open it.
2. Press **▶ Trigger** (top-right). Because `schedule=None`, this manual trigger is
   the only way it runs.
3. Watch the **grid**: each task cell goes yellow (running) then green (success).
   A fully green column is a successful run — `extract`, then `transform`, then
   `load`.

![A green grid after a successful run](/assets/screenshots/dev-grid-tasks.png)

Switch to the **Graph** view to see the same run as the dependency chain you wrote:

![The extract → transform → load graph](/assets/screenshots/dev-graph.png)

## 7 · See the data flow

The pipeline printed as it ran. Click the **`transform`** task cell, open its
**Logs**, and you will see:

```
transform: 1000 rows -> 4 regions
```

Then the **`load`** task's logs show the totals it received from `transform` — the
dict that travelled over XCom:

```
load: totals {'N': ..., 'S': ..., 'E': ..., 'W': ...}; top region ... = ...
```

That is the whole point of TaskFlow: `extract` returned a list, `transform`
received it and returned a dict, `load` received that dict — each hand-off is an
XCom, and you wrote none of the plumbing.

## 8 · Break it on purpose

One last thing worth seeing, because you *will* hit it for real: what a mistake
looks like. With `leoflow lite` still running, add a deliberately broken import to
the top of `dag.py` and save:

```python
import this_module_does_not_exist
```

Within a second or two the UI shows an **import-error banner** on the Dags page —
Leoflow could not load the file, and it tells you exactly why instead of silently
dropping the DAG:

![The import-error banner on the Dags home](/assets/screenshots/dev-import-error-home.png)

Click it for the full traceback:

![The import-error detail with the traceback](/assets/screenshots/dev-import-error-detail.png)

Delete the bad line, save, and the banner clears as the DAG reloads. Press
**Ctrl-C** in the terminal to stop Lite when you are done.

## What you learned

- A DAG project is **`dag.py` + `leoflow.yaml`**; `leoflow init` scaffolds the pair.
- Tasks are `@task` functions; **returning a value and passing it to another task**
  moves data over XCom with no boilerplate.
- The **call graph is the dependency graph** — `load(transform(extract()))`.
- `leoflow validate` catches problems before you run; `leoflow lite` runs it and
  **hot-reloads** so authoring is a tight edit-save-watch loop.

## Next

  layers, and everything `leoflow.yaml` can express.
- [The Lite web editor](/author-dags/lite-web-editor/) — edit `dag.py` in the
  browser instead of a local editor.
- [Examples](/author-dags/examples/) — more runnable DAGs, including this one, to
