title: Scheduler resilience
weight: 70
description: "How the scheduler survives restarts, leader loss and partial failure."
---

How Leoflow keeps the scheduler honest when something goes wrong: a process
dies, an agent goes silent, a dispatch is lost in flight. The control plane
ships **five reapers** — small, single-purpose backstops that turn stuck state
back into observable terminal state, so the dashboard never lies about what's
actually running.

This applies to **both editions**: Lite (single-process) and Pro
(multi-replica with [leader election](/project/adrs/0009-leader-election/)). The
reapers run only on the leader — reaping writes state, and we want one writer
across the fleet. On Kubernetes they run from the leader's **maintenance loop**
(every 30 s, after the pod reconciler's sweep — see below); in Lite there are no
pods, so no pod-based reaper applies and the loop is not started.

## Recovery SLAs

| Failure mode | Detected by | Default SLA | What happens |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Task code wedged past its declared `execution_timeout_seconds`** | **Agent itself** ([#194](https://github.com/neochaotic/leoflow/issues/194)) | **`execution_timeout_seconds`** (per-task) | **TI failed with `execution_timeout: task exceeded N`. Retries kick in if budget remains.** |
| Agent process crashed mid-task (TI in `running`, no heartbeat) | TI heartbeat reaper ([#128](https://github.com/neochaotic/leoflow/issues/128)) | **90 s** | TI failed with `agent_lost`; the TI's pod is deleted so a partitioned-but-alive container stops — unless it has already reached a terminal phase, in which case it is left for the reconciler (see teardown below). Retries kick in if budget remains. |
| Scheduler crashed before dispatching (TI stuck in `queued`) | Dispatch-lost reaper ([#202](https://github.com/neochaotic/leoflow/issues/202)) | **3 min** | TI failed with `dispatch_lost` — but only if no live pod for it exists (see below); any pod still Pending/Running for the attempt is torn down, a finished one is left for the reconciler. Frees the run for the orphan reaper on the next maintenance cycle. |
| Task pod vanished (TI in `running`, no pod at all for its attempt) | Pod-lost reaper | **60 s** after the running transition, then a live pod read | TI failed with `pod_lost`. Only when the apiserver holds no pod for the attempt: a pod that is still there in a terminal phase is left for the reconciler to settle from its termination log (`pod_lost_terminal_pod_defer`). |
| Warm worker died holding attempts (warm pools only) | Warm-worker-lost reaper | next maintenance cycle | Each attempt bound to the dead worker is failed `pod_lost`; refill of the pool is the warm-pool reconciler's job, not the reaper's. |
| Run stuck `running` with no active TIs (post-crash limbo) | Orphan-run reaper ([#120](https://github.com/neochaotic/leoflow/issues/120)) | **5 min** | Run failed with `orphaned`; any remaining active TIs flipped to `failed` and every still-live pod of the run is deleted (its finished pods keep their outcome records for the reconciler). |

Every SLA above is a floor: the reapers run every **30 s**, so detection lands
up to one cycle after the threshold elapses. Worst case end-to-end: a mid-tick
scheduler crash that leaves TIs queued is fully reaped within
**`max(3 min, 5 min) + 30 s`** — the dispatch-lost reaper runs first, then the
orphan-run reaper picks up the now-no-active-TI run on a later cycle.

### Who enforces `execution_timeout` — and why the pod outlives it

A task that declares `execution_timeout_seconds` and runs in its **own** pod has
**two** clocks that could kill it, and only one of them can explain itself. (A
task served by a **warm pool** has only the agent's: warm pods carry no
`activeDeadlineSeconds` at all, and their per-attempt wall-clock bound is the
warm worker's attempt watchdog, derived from
`auth.max_attempt_credential_lifetime` — so everything below about the kubelet
racing the agent does not apply to them.) The **agent** owns the semantic
timeout: it interrupts the user process at the declared boundary and reports
`execution_timeout: task exceeded Ns limit`. The task pod's
`activeDeadlineSeconds` is only the **backstop** for an agent that can no
longer enforce anything (crashed, wedged, partitioned); when the kubelet gets
there first, the pod is gone and the failure reason degrades to what Kubernetes
saw from outside, which cannot name a timeout.

The two clocks do not start together. The kubelet counts from the pod's
`status.startTime`, stamped **before** the image pull. The agent's own clock
starts much later, inside its execute step — after the image pull, the volume
attach and mount, container start, its token bootstrap and exchange, the gRPC
dial, `Register`, `GetTaskSpec`, the environment build (XCom fan-in and secret
resolution, possibly over calls to an external secret backend) and its `RUNNING`
report, whose retry has no budget of its own. On a cold node the image pull
dominates all of it. So the pod deadline is deliberately set **longer** than the
declared timeout:

```text
activeDeadlineSeconds = execution_timeout_seconds
                      + 3 min   (startup headroom = the dispatch-lost threshold)
                      + the pod's terminationGracePeriodSeconds
                        (default 30 s, and capped at 60 s here)
```

The headroom is the dispatch-lost threshold on purpose: that is the window in
which the control plane still presumes healthy startup and defers reaping, so
the kubelet should not be spending the author's execution budget inside it. Note
what the threshold is **not** — a bound on how long startup may take. The
dispatch-lost reaper checks the pod before failing anything and defers while it
is `Pending` or `Running`, so a pod pulling an image for twenty minutes is never
reaped for being slow; the threshold is where the control plane stops assuming a
dispatch landed and starts looking.

The termination grace is added on top rather than folded in — it covers the
shutdown tail (stopping the child, delivering the report), not the startup head.
Only up to 60 s of it is added, however much the DAG declares:
`termination_grace_period_seconds` is unvalidated, and adding an hour of it
verbatim would put the pod's deadline an hour past the declared timeout while
the kubelet grants that same hour of `SIGTERM` grace again on top. The pod spec
still carries the declared value verbatim; only this arithmetic is capped. The
sum is also clamped to `2147483647` (`math.MaxInt32`), the largest
`activeDeadlineSeconds` the apiserver accepts — otherwise a declared timeout
near that bound would be rejected at pod `CREATE` rather than merely never
reached.

Two consequences worth knowing. A pod may outlive its declared timeout by a few
minutes when its agent is dead — that is the backstop doing its job, and the
reapers above still settle the task instance on their own schedule. And a
**pathological** startup (a cold node pulling a multi-gigabyte image, a
throttling registry, or a control-plane outage spanning the `RUNNING`
pre-flight) can still exceed any fixed headroom; the task then fails with the
kubelet's generic reason rather than the timeout diagnosis. If you see that,
the image pull is the thing to fix — and it is worth measuring
`status.startTime` → the agent's `task started` log line on a cold node.

The pod deadline of a task that declares **no** `execution_timeout` is a
different mechanism: a floor derived from `auth.max_attempt_credential_lifetime`
(see below), which takes no headroom because no clock inside the pod races it.

## Cadence: reconcile, then reap

The reapers do **not** run from the scheduler's 1 s tick. They run from the
leader's maintenance loop, which every 30 s performs **one ordered cycle**:

1. the **pod reconciler** sweeps the task pods, recovers each finished pod's
   durable outcome record (a success whose report was lost during an outage is
   recorded as a success — [ADR 0052](/project/adrs/0052-durable-task-outcome/)),
   and garbage-collects old finished pods;
2. **then** the five reapers run.

Each phase runs under its own budget of one interval (30 s): a sweep hung on a
slow apiserver cannot starve the reap, and a reap pass over a large namespace
cannot starve the sweep it depends on. Overrunning a budget is a load signal,
logged at `WARN` with the budget, not an error; a cycle can take up to two
intervals and the ticker coalesces the ticks it overruns.

The order is structural, not a matter of timers lining up. Before this, the
reapers ticked at 1 s and the reconciler at 30 s on an independent clock, so a
pod-lost verdict could land on a pod the reconciler would have recovered as
succeeded at its next sweep. The cost is up to 30 s of extra detection latency
on top of thresholds of 60 s–5 min; reaping is a backstop, never the primary
path, so that trade is the right one.

### The leader-settling gate

A control-plane restart manufactures the very signals the reapers act on:
every in-flight heartbeat looks stale (the receiver was down), a task pod that
finished during the outage looks lost (its terminal report found no server), a
run looks quiet. So after this instance acquires leadership **no reaper fires**
until the leader has **settled** — all three of:

- the **settling grace** (180 s, twice the agent-lost threshold) has elapsed
  since leadership, giving the whole fleet time to re-heartbeat;
- the **pod informer cache has synced**, so the fleet view is complete;
- **a reconciler sweep has completed under this leadership**, so every finished
  pod's true outcome has been recovered before anything is declared lost.

One gate, at the entry of the reaper pass, covers all five reapers (the
warm-worker-lost reaper too: delaying it by the grace only postpones recovering
a dead worker's attempts; pool refill is a separate loop and is not held).
Measured from leadership acquisition, so a re-election resets it. While it
holds, every cycle records `reap_settling_skip`.

**Liveness valve.** A gate that could hold forever would trade "reap wrong" for
"never reap". If the leader has not settled after **2 × grace (360 s)** — the
reconciler cannot list pods, the informer never syncs — the reapers proceed
anyway, with a `WARN` log and a `reap_settling_valve_open` decision on every
cycle the valve stays open. By then the reconciler has had at least four cycles,
so a valve that opens means the sweep really is broken; treat it as an alert.

**Why opening it is safe.** The usual reason a sweep never completes is an
apiserver that cannot be read — unreachable, unauthorized, throttled. The
reconciler's pod LIST and each reaper's own pod-presence LIST hit that same
apiserver, so that failure usually denies every pod-dependent
reaper its authorization too: pod-lost and dispatch-lost defer
(`pod_lost_pod_query_error`, `dispatch_lost_pod_query_error`) and the
warm-worker-lost reaper aborts its cycle with zero marks. They fail closed on
their own, valve or no valve. The two reads can still diverge, though — a broad
namespace-wide LIST can time out where a narrow, server-side-filtered one
succeeds, an informer that never syncs needs `watch` where the reapers need only
`list`, and API Priority and Fairness can starve the heavy request while the
cheap one gets through. And because the valve is *designed* to open, it is
never the only guard: the pod-lost reaper fails a task only when the attempt has
**no pod object at all**, a state no grace, cadence or election timing can
manufacture. A finished pod is a present pod, and stays the reconciler's.

The server validates the timing ladder these depend on at boot and refuses to
start if a constant was moved out of order:
`heartbeat (15 s) < agent-lost threshold (90 s) < settling grace (180 s) < attempt token TTL (10 min)`,
and `2 × maintenance interval (60 s) < settling grace`, so at least two whole
reconcile-then-reap cycles complete inside the grace.

## Tuning the thresholds

The thresholds and the settling grace are **build-time constants**
(`executor.DefaultReaperConfig`), not operator knobs: they sit on the ladder
above, and the boot-time validator exists precisely because moving one out of
order turns a restart into a false reap. The one operator-tunable rung is
`auth.max_attempt_credential_lifetime`, which must stay above the attempt token
TTL; boot fails naming the key if it does not. Setting it non-positive is
accepted but disables the renewal ceiling, the task-pod `activeDeadlineSeconds`
floor and the warm-pool attempt watchdog together, so boot logs a `WARN` naming
the key.

The defaults are conservative on purpose: too-tight thresholds risk reaping a
legitimately slow dispatch (Kubernetes pod-pull latency under contention) or a
busy agent.

## The "do no harm" rule

Each reaper requires a **positive observable signal** before failing
anything:

- **TI heartbeat reaper** — only fires on TIs that *did* heartbeat at least
  once and then went silent. A TI that never heartbeated (e.g. a pod that never
  started, so no agent ever reported) is left alone.
- **Dispatch-lost reaper** — requires a non-zero `queued_at` older than the
  threshold AND, on Kubernetes, confirmation that no live pod for the TI
  exists. If a pod for the TI is `Pending`/`Running`, the dispatch actually
  landed and the node is just slow to pull the image (a cold-node false
  positive, [#461](https://github.com/neochaotic/leoflow/issues/461)) — the
  reaper defers. If pod liveness can't be determined (K8s API error), it also
  defers. A TI without a `queued_at` stamp is too poorly observed to reap.
- **Pod-lost reaper** — requires a `running` TI past its 60 s liveness floor
  AND a live read confirming no Pending/Running pod exists for exactly that
  attempt. A cached "pod present" defers without an API call; a cache miss is
  never trusted and falls through to the live read; a read error defers. And,
  like every reaper, it waits for the leader-settling gate — so a pod that
  finished during an outage is recovered by the reconciler, not failed.
- **Warm-worker-lost reaper** — requires a live LIST of the warm pods (not the
  cache) showing the bound worker gone; a LIST error aborts the pass with zero
  marks. It never deletes a pod: a warm worker outlives its attempts.
- **Orphan-run reaper** — requires `state = 'running'` AND no active TI on
  the run. A run with any TI in `scheduled`/`queued`/`running` is left alone
  (the dispatch-lost reaper unblocks this case by failing the stuck queued
  TIs first, so a later cycle sees no active TIs).

## Tearing down the reaped task's pod

Failing a TI in the metadatabase is not enough on its own: a reaped task's
pod can still be running user code, which breaks at-most-once execution if
that work commits or a retry runs it again
([#474](https://github.com/neochaotic/leoflow/issues/474)). So, **after** the
durable DB transition, each reaper tears the pod down:

- The **heartbeat** and **dispatch-lost** reapers delete exactly the reaped
  TI's pod, pinned by `(run-id, task-id, try-number)` labels — a retry
  dispatches a new pod with a new try-number, so a newer live attempt can
  never be the one deleted.
- The **orphan-run** reaper deletes every pod of the abandoned run (the
  run-id is unique per run, so no other run's pod can match).
- **A pod that already reached a terminal phase (`Succeeded`/`Failed`) is
  skipped, not deleted** ([#928](https://github.com/neochaotic/leoflow/issues/928)).
  It has no container left to stop, so deleting it would buy nothing and cost
  the durable outcome record on its termination message — the only evidence the
  reconciler can settle the attempt from
  ([ADR 0052](/project/adrs/0052-durable-task-outcome/)). Collecting those pods
  is the reconciler's job: it settles each one, then garbage-collects it once it
  ages past the 10-minute grace. The skip is enforced once, at the teardown
  itself, so it holds for every reaper — including the heartbeat reaper, which
  fires on heartbeat staleness alone at 90 s and reads no pod state, and the
  orphan-run reaper, which applies it per pod inside the run. No reaper's
  decision changes: a TI the reaper marked stays marked. Look for
  `reap teardown: task pod is already in a terminal phase` at INFO to see which
  pods were left behind; a failed *delete* is the `*_pod_delete_error` decision
  below, which is a different thing.
- A pod in phase `Unknown` **is** deleted. It may still be running a container,
  which is the case teardown exists for, and the reconciler treats `Unknown` as
  non-terminal — it neither settles nor collects it — so nothing else would.
- Belt and suspenders: the control plane also answers a **stale** agent
  `ReportState`/`Heartbeat` — one whose attempt no longer matches the live
  row — with `should_terminate`, so a reaped-but-still-alive pod that we
  couldn't delete (e.g. during a K8s API outage) cancels its own work. The
  "stale" test is exactly the source-state + `try_number` guard the state
  write already uses ([#467](https://github.com/neochaotic/leoflow/issues/467)):
  the report applies for the live, matching attempt, so a live execution is
  never told to stop.

These teardown steps are best-effort and off the critical path: a delete
failure is logged and metered but never undoes the DB reap, and the pod's own
`activeDeadlineSeconds` plus the reconciler's GC remain backstops. In Lite
(subprocess executor) there are no pods, so only the DB transition and the
`should_terminate` signal apply.

A terminal pod the teardown skips is collected by the reconciler, so a
reconciler that is not sweeping leaves those pod objects behind. That is not a
new dependency: every normally-finished task pod has always been the
reconciler's to collect, and the reap-time delete only ever covered the subset
belonging to a reaped TI or run. A terminated pod holds no node CPU or memory —
it costs an API object and a slot against any `count/pods` quota — and
Kubernetes' own terminated-pod GC (`--terminated-pod-gc-threshold`, 12500 by
default) is the cluster-level floor under it. A reconciler stuck for longer
than that shows up first as `reap_settling_valve_open`, which is the label to
alert on.

## The load-bearing invariant

Recovery is bounded by the slowest reaper that applies, not the fastest —
usually fine, sometimes worth tuning
(ADR [0031](/project/adrs/0031-scheduler-architecture/)). The invariant that governs
every reap decision is **never fail or tear down the live current attempt —
only one that is genuinely stale or lost**, and **never destroy the evidence of
one that already finished**. It is preserved end-to-end: the DB
transitions are guarded on source state (`WHERE state IN (...)`), pod deletes
are pinned to the exact `(run, task, try)` reaped and skip a pod already in a
terminal phase, the dispatch-lost reaper
defers whenever a pod is live or its liveness is unknown, and the
`should_terminate` signal fires only when the reporting attempt has provably
moved on. When in doubt, a reaper defers rather than reap.

## Observability

Each reap action is metered as a scheduler decision. Watch these labels in
your Prometheus dashboard:

| Metric label | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `agent_lost` | TI failed by the heartbeat reaper |
| `dispatch_lost` | TI failed by the dispatch-lost reaper |
| `dispatch_lost_deferred` | Dispatch-lost skipped because the TI's pod is live (slow start, [#461](https://github.com/neochaotic/leoflow/issues/461)) — a healthy signal, not a fault |
| `pod_lost` | TI failed by the pod-lost reaper (no pod at all for the attempt) |
| `pod_lost_terminal_pod_defer` | Pod-lost skipped because the attempt's pod is still there in a terminal phase — the reconciler settles it from its termination log; reaping would delete that evidence. Healthy as a *transient*. Sustained past two maintenance cycles means the reconciler is not settling and those task instances are stranded `running`, not about to settle: correlate with `reap_settling_valve_open` and `pod_lost_pod_query_error` |
| `warm_worker_lost` | TI failed by the warm-worker-lost reaper (its warm worker is gone) |
| `orphan_reaped` | Run failed by the orphan-run reaper |
| `reap_settling_skip` | The whole reaper pass was held because the leader has not settled yet (grace, informer sync, or a post-leadership reconciler sweep still pending) — expected for ~3 min after every (re-)election |
| `reap_settling_valve_open` | The leader never settled within 2 × grace and the reapers ran anyway; the reconciler sweep or the pod informer is broken — **alert on this** |
| `reap_gate_skip` | The pass was skipped because this instance is stepping down, no longer leads, or is shutting down — a healthy signal during rollouts |
| `agent_lost_list_error`, `dispatch_lost_list_error`, `orphan_list_error`, `pod_lost_list_error`, `warm_worker_lost_list_error` | Reaper's list query failed; the next cycle will retry |
| `dispatch_lost_pod_query_error`, `pod_lost_pod_query_error` | Pod liveness could not be read (K8s API error); the reaper deferred rather than risk a false positive |
| `agent_lost_pod_delete_error`, `dispatch_lost_pod_delete_error`, `orphan_pod_delete_error`, `pod_lost_pod_delete_error` | Pod teardown after a reap failed; the DB reap stands and the pod's `activeDeadlineSeconds`/GC are backstops |

A sustained non-zero rate on any of these is worth investigating — reapers
are backstops, not the primary path; if they fire often, something upstream
is broken.

## What's NOT a scheduler concern

- **Postgres unreachable** — the scheduler's `Heartbeat()` goes unhealthy;
  the `/monitor/health` endpoint surfaces it; runs queue up and resume when
  the DB returns.
- **Agent's task container OOM-killed** — surfaces as a non-zero exit code
  through the agent (if it survived) or as `agent_lost` (if the agent went
  with it).
- **K8s API outage** — pods stay where they are; new dispatches fail at the
  executor layer (visible as `dispatch_failed` metric on the
  [BufferedDispatcher](/project/adrs/0031-scheduler-architecture/)); the
  dispatch-lost reaper does NOT fail TIs during the outage — it cannot read
  pod liveness, so it defers (`dispatch_lost_pod_query_error`) rather than
  risk a false positive. Reap-time pod teardown is likewise skipped and
  retried once the API returns; a reaped-but-alive pod stops itself via the
  `should_terminate` signal on its next heartbeat.
