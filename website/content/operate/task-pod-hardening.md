title: Task pod hardening
description: What the executor puts in every task pod's securityContext, what readOnlyRootFilesystem changes, and how to run task pods in a Pod Security Admission `restricted` namespace.

Every task runs in its own pod. This page covers the security posture those pods
get by default, the one knob that tightens it further, and what to expect when a
cluster policy audits them.

## What you get without configuring anything

The executor builds each task container with:

| field | value | always emitted? |
|---|---|---|
| `allowPrivilegeEscalation` | `false` | yes |
| `capabilities.drop` | `["ALL"]` | yes |
| `seccompProfile` | `RuntimeDefault` | yes |
| `automountServiceAccountToken` | `false` (pod level) | yes |
| `runAsNonRoot` | `true` | follows `taskPodSecurity.runAsNonRoot` (default `true`) |
| `fsGroup` | `65532` (pod level) | only when `runAsNonRoot` is on |

The first four cost an ordinary task nothing and do not depend on the UID, so
the executor sets them whatever the image runs as. The last two move together:
turn `taskPodSecurity.runAsNonRoot` off for a fleet whose images legitimately
run as root, and the executor drops `runAsNonRoot` *and* the pod-level `fsGroup`
— a root task already writes its volumes as root, so there is nothing to fix,
and leaving the pod context unset skips the kubelet's recursive volume chown.

Two of these are worth understanding rather than just reading.

**`runAsNonRoot` without `runAsUser`.** Leoflow deliberately does not pin a UID.
The kubelet resolves the image's own `USER` and refuses the pod if it resolves
to root. That means a **numeric** `USER` in your DAG image — `USER 65532:65532`,
which the Leoflow base image uses — is required: a symbolic `USER myuser` cannot
be resolved by the kubelet before the container starts, and the pod fails
admission with `CreateContainerConfigError`. If you build a DAG image from
something other than our base, make the final `USER` numeric.

**No ServiceAccount token.** Task pods authenticate to the control plane with
their own per-task token over gRPC and never call the Kubernetes API, so
mounting a SA token would hand a credential to untrusted code for no reason.

## `readOnlyRootFilesystem`

```yaml
taskPodSecurity:
  readOnlyRootFilesystem: true   # default: false
```

With this on, the task container's root filesystem is mounted read-only and the
executor mounts an `emptyDir` at `/tmp` so anything that needs scratch space
still has it. The Leoflow base image already points dbt's target, log and
profiles paths at `/tmp`, so a dbt task needs no further configuration.

**It is off by default** because a DAG image that writes anywhere outside `/tmp`
— a pip install at runtime, a library caching into `$HOME`, a tool writing next
to its input — stops working the moment you turn it on. Turn it on deliberately,
and run your DAGs once after.

Two things to know before you rely on it:

- **The `/tmp` emptyDir has no `sizeLimit`.** The volume itself is unbounded, but
  the DAG author already controls this per task: set
  `resources.limits.ephemeral_storage` in `leoflow.yaml` (ADR 0054), which the
  kubelet enforces against the task container. A namespace `LimitRange` default,
  or failing that the node's own eviction threshold, is the cluster-side backstop
  — reach for it only when you cannot change the DAG.
- **Airflow logs a warning in every task.** With a read-only root, Airflow cannot
  create `/home/leoflow/airflow/logs` and says so:
  `Could not create log folder … Read-only file system … Airflow will continue`.
  It is harmless — Leoflow captures task output over its own channel, unaffected
  — but it appears at the top of every task log.

## Running in a `restricted` namespace

The defaults above satisfy Pod Security Admission's `restricted` profile, so you
can label the task namespace and task pods will be admitted:

```bash
kubectl label ns <taskNamespace> pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce=restricted
```

Nothing else is required. `restricted` does **not** require
`readOnlyRootFilesystem`; the two are independent, and you can enable either
without the other.

## Verifying it

On a running task pod:

```bash
kubectl get pod <task-pod> -n <taskNamespace> -o jsonpath='{.spec.containers[0].securityContext}{"\n"}{range .spec.volumes[*]}{.name} {end}{"\n"}'
```

With `readOnlyRootFilesystem: true` you should see `readOnlyRootFilesystem=true`,
`runAsNonRoot=true`, and a `leoflow-tmp` volume among the pod's volumes. Task
pods are short-lived, so read this while one is running, or from a pod that has
finished but not yet been garbage-collected.

**Verified on GKE 1.35 (Standard):** task pods admitted by a
`restricted`-enforcing namespace with `readOnlyRootFilesystem: true`, running a
hybrid DAG whose dbt models materialized normally.

## Memory limits, and what happens without one

A task pod gets the CPU, memory and ephemeral-storage `requests` and `limits` the
DAG author declares under `resources`. Leoflow adds none of its own.

**If nobody declares a memory limit, there is none.** The pod inherits whatever
the namespace imposes, and if the namespace imposes nothing the task can grow
until the NODE runs short. The kubelet then starts evicting to reclaim memory,
and what it evicts is chosen by QoS class and by how far each pod is over its
request, not by who caused the problem. So the symptom appears on someone else's
task while the one at fault keeps running. A `LimitRange` on the task namespace
is the operator-side answer; a declared limit is the author-side one.

A pod with `requests` but no `limits` lands in QoS class `Burstable`. It runs
fine until the node tightens and then becomes an eviction candidate, which means
the failure shows up under load and not in testing.

### Reading an out-of-memory failure

When a limit IS set and the task exceeds it, the kernel kills the task process
and leoflow reports:

```
out of memory: the kernel killed this task's process. Raise the task's memory
limit (resources.limits.memory); if it uses an engine with its own memory
budget, such as DuckDB, set that budget too, because it sizes itself from
detected RAM and may not see the container's limit.
```

That message is derived from the kernel's own OOM-kill counter for the pod's
cgroup, sampled either side of the task, rather than from the exit code. The
distinction matters when you are debugging: exit 137 is SIGKILL and an external
kill looks identical, so a task killed for memory and a task killed by something
else are the same number and different problems.

### The second half of a memory limit

Setting `resources.limits.memory` alone is sometimes not enough.

An engine that manages its own memory budget — DuckDB is the common one, but
Spark, Polars and the JVM all behave this way — sizes that budget from the RAM it
detects. Depending on version and platform it may see the NODE's memory rather
than the container's limit. It then plans for memory it will never be allowed to
touch, does not spill to disk, and is killed instead of degrading.

A DuckDB task in a pod limited to 4 GiB should be told so:

```sql
SET memory_limit = '3GB';
```

Leaving headroom under the pod limit on purpose: the Python process, the agent
and the engine's own overhead all live in the same cgroup, so the engine's budget
should not be the whole of it.
