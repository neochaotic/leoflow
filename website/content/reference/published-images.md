description: "Every container image and chart Leoflow publishes, how each is tagged, and which tags are immutable."
---

Every release publishes three images and one chart to GitHub Container Registry.
This page says what each one is, who pulls it, and how it is tagged, because the
tag is the part people get wrong.

## What is published

| artifact | what it is | who pulls it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ghcr.io/neochaotic/leoflow-server` | the control plane: API, scheduler, UI | the Helm chart, and `docker compose` for the demo |
| `ghcr.io/neochaotic/leoflow-migrate` | schema migrations, run as a Helm pre-install and pre-upgrade hook | the chart's migration Job |
| `ghcr.io/neochaotic/leoflow-runtime` | the task base image, one per supported Python line | your DAG image's `FROM`, at `leoflow compile --build` |
| `oci://ghcr.io/neochaotic/charts/leoflow` | the Helm chart | `helm install` / `helm upgrade` |

## How each is tagged

| artifact | tags | mutable? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `leoflow-server` | `0.4.8` **and** `v0.4.8` | no, both point at the same digests |
| `leoflow-migrate` | `0.4.8` **and** `v0.4.8` | no |
| `leoflow-runtime` | `py3.11-v0.4.8` | no |
| `leoflow-runtime` | `py3.11` | **yes**, republished by every release |
| the chart | `0.4.8` | no |

The server and migrate images carry both the bare and the `v`-prefixed tag, and
both resolve to identical digests, so either spelling works.

Every release republishes `leoflow-runtime:py<version>` pointing at its own
build. A `FROM ghcr.io/neochaotic/leoflow-runtime:py3.11` rebuilt next month is
a different base than the same line built today. Pin the versioned tag when you
want a build to reproduce.

## Which base your DAG image gets

`leoflow compile --build` writes the `FROM` for you, and it picks between those
two tag shapes **based on the CLI you are running**:

| your `leoflow` binary | the `FROM` it writes |
| --- | --- |
| a released build (`leoflow version` shows a clean `X.Y.Z`) | `ghcr.io/neochaotic/leoflow-runtime:py<ver>-v<X.Y.Z>`, immutable |
| a development build (built from source, a dirty tree, or a `git describe` version) | `ghcr.io/neochaotic/leoflow-runtime:py<ver>`, the moving line |

A release pins its own base so a compile from that release reproduces byte for
byte (ADR 0003). A development build has no published versioned base to point
at, so it falls back to the moving line.

This has a consequence worth knowing: **two people compiling the same project
can get different base images**, if one runs a released CLI and the other runs
one built from source. If that matters to you, set `base_image` in
`leoflow.yaml` explicitly, which overrides both rules and is used verbatim.

`python_version` selects the `py<ver>` part; see
[Python version support](/reference/configuration/#python-version-support) for
the supported lines and the deprecation schedule.

## Verifying what you pulled

Artifacts on the GitHub release are checksummed (SHA-256) and the checksums
file is signed with cosign, keyless. The `leoflow-server` manifests are signed
by digest, so both tag shapes are covered:

```bash
cosign verify ghcr.io/neochaotic/leoflow-server:0.4.8 \
  --certificate-identity-regexp 'https://github.com/neochaotic/leoflow/.*' \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com
```

## Older releases

Every image above is published per release and nothing is deleted, so an older
version stays pullable by its versioned tag. The exception is the moving
`leoflow-runtime:py<ver>` line, which only ever names the newest release.
