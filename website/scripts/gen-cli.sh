# Generate the CLI reference for the Hugo site from Cobra.
#
# Parity with the live MkDocs pipeline (.github/workflows/docs.yml), which runs
#   go run ./cmd/leoflow gen-docs --dir docs/cli
# Here the same generator writes into website/content/reference/cli/ and the raw
# Cobra markdown is post-processed for Hugo:
#   * a front-matter block (title / linkTitle / weight) is prepended, since
#     Cobra emits a bare "## <command>" heading with no front matter and Docsy
#     needs one to title and order the page;
#   * the "SEE ALSO" cross-links (`](leoflow_foo.md)`) are rewritten to the
#     Hugo pretty URL (`](/reference/cli/leoflow_foo/)`) — with Goldmark's link
#     render hooks disabled (see hugo.toml), a bare `.md` link would 404.
#
# Idempotent: reruns overwrite the generated *.md and never touch _index.md.
# The generated tree IS committed (parallel-track preview convenience); CI
# reruns this before `hugo` so the pages can never drift from the binary.
