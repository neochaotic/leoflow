"""
Single source of truth for the Leoflow docs Hugo+Docsy migration (Phase F1).

Maps every source page under docs/ to its new home under website/content/, per the
approved 9-section UX-first IA. Drives BOTH file placement and internal-link
rewriting (a link's old target is resolved relative to its source file, then looked
up here to get the new Hugo URL).

`PAGES` is the copy-and-convert set (one source md -> one dest md). Merges, splits,
_index landings, stubs and Scalar are handled by hand in build_site.py; their URLs
are registered in EXTRA_URLS so links still resolve.
